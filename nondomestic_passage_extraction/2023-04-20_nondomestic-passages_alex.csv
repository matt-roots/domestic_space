2,"When she died — the only creature who ever really loved me — I laid the half of tlie last salary I received in my husband's desk. He was out that day at a picnic in the suburbs of London. I went and had a view of him reclining on the grass at a flaxen-haired English girl's feet. I overheard his whisper to the young creature's mother or aunt : * She is a girl to live and die for ; ' and then I turned my back, left him to his fate, and w^ent to seek my own. "" Do you know^ what I did ? Having just lost sight of my mother in the grave, and had a glimpse of my husband, as I have stated, I had small chance of keeping my head steady enough to guide the capering of my feet.

Paris will be in arms to-morrow, and the court will take the opportunity of pouring upon the city in revolt its troops of mercenaries. It may succeed ; the nascent revolution may be strangled by the iron grasp of the military, and then recommences the reign of tyranny. It may fail, and then the people are lashed into fury, and will not spare the conquered. The stroke is bold.' ' What is to be done ? ' '",alex

In other circumstances Bruce might have resisted the banishment indignantly; as it was, she was too confounded, affronted, and wretched to resist. It had been found impossible to keep Claud from being taken before a magistrate; and while the minister of Birkenbarns was still lying in his manse stricken and incapable, from the effects of the treatment he had re- ceived, it was equally impossible for the most lenient justice to avoid committing the young man to stand a trial. He ought to have known better, and he had taken the law into his own hands on a piece of provocation, which, however it might strike sensitive, re- fined minds, was still a trifle in the eyes of the law. However, a point could be stretched in admitting the laird to bail, and plenty of bail was at his service.

102,"1 would only remark, that to such persons, 1 fear this portion of Catherine's story will be in a great degree revolting, since I have now to exhibit her under these particular circumstances. Truth compels me to say, that nei- ther the most affectionate behaviour towards herself, nor the most guarded conduct to Augusta on the part of St. Aubyn, nor the frequent endeavours she herself made to repel every suspicious thought, could restore to Catherine that untroubled peace of mind, and entire confidence in her husband's love which had rendered her residence at C hitherto so delightful and so happy. Augusta was that heartless, inhuman being, who, even as a wife, had no triumph so great as that of practising upon the vanity (it would be unwor- thy to say the hearts) of men. St. Aubyn was still her mark ; and, though he forbore to offer her the pointed attentions she endeavoured to excite, she put it almost out of his power to address her with the merely polite civi- lity he was desirous ofextendingtowards her, by the footingof familiarity on which she seemed determined to receive him. The most steadily governed mind would certainly sometimes have been shaken, by the attempts she levelled against its peace; how much more, then, was that of the unfortunate Catherine disturbed ! The gaiety of her disposition — the sweetness of her temper, which, though from the vivacity of her undisciplined feelings subject to hasty ebullitions of anger at untoward circumstances, had still been of that affectionate kind, which rendered her to St. Aubyn the most attractive and engaging- of women — all was fading away — and, insensibly to herself, she was daily yielding to an irritability of mind, which betrayed itself at first in snch trifles as St. Anbvn considered it unworthy to notice ; but which gradually strengthened into a sort of conduct, which it was impossible for him to pass over without comment. Wishing as much as possible to avoid the presence of Augusta, whom she detested with a hatred which no prin- ciples within her taught her the sin of indulging, Catherine had evaded as often as she could, under a plea of indispo- sition, the frequent invitations she and her husband received from the Elliots.",alex

217,"No, no, my conscience won't allow me !"" remonstrated the young viscount, waiving his hands and head ; — "" these people are intoxi- cated!— and since there is no Father Mathew in Sic — Sic— Sicily to repress so beastly a vice, and bring them to a sense of their sit — situa- tion, — I feel called upon to address them."" His intentions were luckily circumvented by the sudden whirr of a rocket cleaving the air, to afford a signal, by its falling stars, to the city, that the doors of the cathedral were thrown open, and the various confraternities and companies issuing forth in solemn proces- sion, with the reliques of their several saints. More hurry, — more noise, — more music, — more laughter ; — and amid the general uproar, we reached the chief street, the Strada del Cassaro, illuminated throughout its length with a profusion of lamps sparkling on lofty pyra- midal stages. Already, the various processions were pa- rading their shrines, and banners, and pas- toral ornaments of gold or silver, in solemn progress in honour of Palermo's darling saint; — and as soon as the gradual restora- tion of Lord Hebberston permitted, the duke made the best of his way into the cathedral, the illumination of which would have better become a ball-room, than that sacred dome. Chandelier above chandelier, — girandole above girandole, diffused an all-dazzling light in the lofty choirs; exhibiting in rich relief the lacelike carvings of white marble, the stately tombs of porphyry and marble, and 10 the eighty columns of oriental granite sup- porting the roof. How strangely would this midnight blaze of day have startled the Normans, who super- posed on a Saracenic mosque that gorgeous temple of Christianity ! —",alex

232,"He is a liar,"" observed the tall man; "" give him rice indeed ! here is something would suit him better"" (taking up one of the pistols) — at which the short man laughed most heartily. I began to augur that no rice would now fall to my share, and I sat suffering the torments of hunger, until the two fellows had finished their repast. The tallest man, having washed his mouth and cleaned his white teeth, approached me as I sat on a stone in the doorway, looking down upon me as he would do upon a reptile which he had half a mind to trample upon out of sheer wantonness. I did not dare to raise my eyes to gaze on this for- midable personage, but sat perfectly silent, suffering the keen pangs of hunger. After some time had elapsed, the fellow said, "" Who are you, and what is your business at Asseerghur?"" This was indeed a per- plexing question ; I knew if I told the real truth my life would be in danger, if these men chanced to be connected with Trim- buckje's schemes ; and if I replied I had no business there, I should be looked upon with suspicion : if I made myself a person of no consequence, I should be despised; and if I made any pretensions, I should be deemed a liar with very good reason.",alex
237,"The particulars of this deed of hor- ror were widely circulated ; and as an accurate knowledge of the facts was of the deepest interest to the near kinsman of the victim Isabella, he and his mili- tary friend advanced towards the spot; the pursuer having first made a merit of circumstances, by writing to Flora, that he had repented of that purpose of revenge from which she had formerly dissuaded him ; dwelling largely upon the thankfulness which he himself felt, that the stain of blood in a private, though justifiable cause, was not on his hand. As Castlecreaghy was on tlie conti- nent at any rate, and as his mind was at ease, both upon the ground of the immorality of fighting, and the ridicule of not fighting, he resolved to examine the country for a few days. For this purpose, he and his friend agreed to journey together, both for the sake of companionship, and because the laird^s French was a little the worse, not for the wear, but for the want of it. In the course of their peregrinations, they had occasion to pass through a small village, in a remote part of the Hainault, and as the day was Sunday, they resolved to attend church. The church was small, and the worshippei's few, though very devout and orderly in their conduct. The priest made his appearance. He seemed as if both Time and Death had forgotten him.",alex
242,"He flung across, and stood yearning down upon her, the words breaking from him in gasps. "" I wish you were steeped in humiliation so that humanity shrunk from you, do you hear that ? . . . I wish you were an outcast, and a beggar, for I should love you then, and then you would understand my love ! ... I should want you if you were maimed, ... I should want you if you were blind ! By the spirit of my dearest Dead if your touch were leprous I'd wind your arms round my neck, and love you into the grave.",alex
247,"And all, as they reasoned, at their expense, as they had, one or other of them, to get up like slaves half an hour earlier every morning — because o^ her bargain. So a general ill will was excited against the poor young creature, which shewed itself by a more than usual proportion being displayed of that negligent insolence with which servants, if not closely looked after, are apt to treat go- vernesses. Selina came down pouting and looking dark as midnight — at once angry and rebellious. It was a chilly morning certainly, and her hands were red with the cold ; and her maid had done nothino; but abuse Miss Nevil all the time she had been dressing her. So Selina came in with a resohitlon to be as tiresome as she possibly could. *'",alex
