1,"How power- fully do the early associations of music recall the scenes and friends of our childish days ! Do you re- member those simple lines, Mifis De Cardonnell.^— * My eyes are dim with childish tears, My heart is idly stirr'd. For the same sound is in mine ears Which in those days I heard !' "" Emily repeated to him some stanzas from Leyden\s beautiful Ode to Scottish music, and enchanted by the beauty of her recitation, he begged her to try to re- member some more verses. "" I remember only another,"" she said, "" which alludes to the Hindu belief that earthly music recalls to our memory the feelings and recollections of that Paradise which they believe our souls enjoyed in a state of pre-existence.

2,"When she died — the only creature who ever really loved me — I laid the half of tlie last salary I received in my husband's desk. He was out that day at a picnic in the suburbs of London. I went and had a view of him reclining on the grass at a flaxen-haired English girl's feet. I overheard his whisper to the young creature's mother or aunt : * She is a girl to live and die for ; ' and then I turned my back, left him to his fate, and w^ent to seek my own. "" Do you know^ what I did ? Having just lost sight of my mother in the grave, and had a glimpse of my husband, as I have stated, I had small chance of keeping my head steady enough to guide the capering of my feet. So I took my passage to a French island, and to make it difficult to trace me, called myself Madame Olympia.",alex
3,"It seemed a dream — a vision, which could have no truth in it ; and yet it came back and back upon him with an awful sense of all its consequences. Was not the love itself rash, mad, hopeless '? Had not the avowal of it been wrong, base, ungrateful 1 What would Mr. West wood think — he who had loaded him with kindness — he who had fostered, with such tender- ness, his youth, promoted his views in manhood, interested himself in every turn of his fate — what would he think, when he found that the child of his bounty, the son of the simple village carpenter, had raised his eyes to his daughter, had used the ad- vantages which the bounty of himself and his family had bestowed, to win her love, and perhaps to darken all the prospects of her future life 1 Bitter — bitter, was his self reproach ; but it was nothing to his despair. To hope was mere frenzy: he knew it well and yet what could he do? He could not fly. He was too weak to go immediately. He had promised to remain, even if he had been strong enough ; and had he not done so, could he leave Mary to despair like his ?",jessica
4,"Everyone ought to do their best to spare you.' * But I do not want to be spared,' returned Audrey, echoing her mother's sigh ; ' so please send Gage to me, and tell her not to stop too long. Crauford can tell her when tea is ready.' And then Mrs. Ross left her very reluctantly. Geraldine's face was suffused with tears as she sat down beside the bed and took her sister's hand. Audrey shook her head at her. * Gage, I don't mean to allow this ; you and mother are not to make yourselves miserable on my account.' ' How are we to help it, Audrey ?' replied Geraldine with a sob ; * I have never seen you look so ill in your life, and no wonder — this unhappy engagement !",svenja
5,"Although Miss Biddy was daily pestered with accusations against her knavish ward, she determined not to credit a word to his dispa- ragement, especially as these were accusations not substantiated by evidence, which they could not well be, for he had never yet been actually and substantively detected in a viola- tion of the criminal code. He therefore pur- sued his career with the greater recklessness, whilst the idea of an absolute predestination to eternal life had so fixed upon his conviction, that he claimed to himself impunity from sin as a matter of divine and indefeasible privilege. Impelled by the confidence which such a con- clusion naturally awakened, he cast himself into all sorts of peril without once looking to the issue ; and to Erasmus's question in the colloquy of the soldier's confession, "" Do you never think what will become of your soul if you are knocked on the head ?"" he would no doubt have exclaimed with the murderous thane — "" I bear a charmed life !""* The venerable Miss Mackinnon, who had now attained a period of most respectable senility — for she was by this time fast verging upon seventy — though she became at times excessively peevish when the tricks of her ward were made the topic of discourse, dog- gedly adhered to her old conclusion that a pre- * Macbeth. destinated sinner must make an elected saint ; and, therefore, no matter to her how the dogs of the world, who had "" neither part nor lot'^ with him , represented his backslidings, she felt satisfied nevertheless, that he was perfectly secure of a communion with Calvin in the world of beati- fied spirits, where he would exult over the fall of Arminius and his three able defenders, Barnevelt, Grotius, and Hoogarbetz_, whom the Oudewater heretic had seduced from the sim- plicity of the truth, and involved in that ever- lasting doom which he had brought down upon himself.",matt

7,"In twenty-four hours,' continued Gr^goire, ' Paris will explode, and blood will flow. The result of this stroke of policy is certain. Paris will be in arms to-morrow, and the court will take the opportunity of pouring upon the city in revolt its troops of mercenaries. It may succeed ; the nascent revolution may be strangled by the iron grasp of the military, and then recommences the reign of tyranny. It may fail, and then the people are lashed into fury, and will not spare the conquered. The stroke is bold.' ' What is to be done ? ' '",alex

9,"Sometimes she would talk wildly and laugh gaily ; but at others, she would sink into profound fits of thought, gaze forth into the vacant air, and answer questions quite astray. Even Lady Fleetwood seemed in a degree to feel the irritating effects of expectation. Once, in the middle of breakfast, without a word having been uttered regarding travels or travellers, she suddenly lifted her head, and said, "" I wonder at what hour they will arrive ;"" and some time afterwards, when walking for a moment on the terrace with Maria, she observed in the same abrupt manner, "" They will have a fine day for their arrival, at all events."" As the day wore on, and the hour at which they might be expected passed, Maria grew more thoughtful, more anxious, more grave; and Lady Ann, after watching her friend's face for a moment, said, "" Come Maria; this will not do. Let us go and amuse ourselves some way. We will walk down to the steward's, and see the hens and chickens, and talk about lambs, and be quite pastoral.",svenja

She sat down to recall mi- nutely every circumstance of what had just passed, every word, every look; she she finished, by persuading herself, thafc his calmness was affected, that the best method she could possibly take, was by a show of resistance to bully him out of his indifference. She little knew what she hazarded : when the danger of losing her husbands love was imaginary, and solely of her own creating, it affected her in the most violent manner ; but now that the peril Was real and immi- nent, she was insensible to its existence.

The dinner was ordered at eight, but the worthy Baronet still continued his old pur- suits, and was as punctual to his engage- ments as ever, so that it was nearly ten o'clock before he made his appearance, and called for dinner. The party consisted of six, amongst whom were two great cronies of his, desperate hard drinkers, who were engaged to ply our hero so as to make him jolly, if possible ; they acquitted them- selves very well, but Lord Dorimont was on his guard. When they thought that he seemed some- what flushed, they proposed a little chucker hazard, and a box and dice were produced. They began to play heavy stakes amongst themselves, but neither Jack Smith nor Lord Dorimont would bet any of the party, only backing their own hands. Sir Harry saw it was no use to persist, and pretending to vote private play a bore, with an assurance (it was the height of as- surance) that he could not bear to win money of his friends, he suggested going to a hell to finish the night, but neither to Hookey's nor to the Milton ; he therefore took the party to a hell in King Street, well deserving of that name, if ever there was a hell upon earth : the gang was composed of broken- down gamesters, bankrupt tradesmen, and the very dregs of society, and off-scourings of the town.

Lady Montague had been the saving angel of her mother ; who, though educated in the highest and happiest hopes, finally reverted to this dear, and once humble friend, as the sole j^rotector of her child ; nor was the appeal fruitless even when the heart that made it ceased to beat ; since to cherish the little Clara as a wife for one of her own sons, was among the few romantic projects which Lady Montague ever formed. The over- whelming succession of calamities that swept both mother and children to one common grave, left to Sir Arthur the painfid task of restoring Miss Rochford to those who were called her natural friends. lUit he had soon too much reason to regret having given up his lovely charge.

In receiving her again to his protection, Sir Arthur was not, however, quite satisfied that he acted wisely. With the indecision, therefore, common to bounded minds, he attempted to find a medium where judgment would have told him that there could be none : and confining his pre- cautions to the simple one of removinor her from his own roof, he encouraged the hope that time and chance, if not the early return of Mr. Cavendish, would wholly separate her from Montague.",mark

30,"There was something incongruous and inconceivable in the idea of the child of Cornelia a woman, married to his cousin. He feared to see in her an image of the being who had subdued his heart of hearts, and laid prostrate his whole soul; he trembled to catch the sound of her voice, lest it might echo tones which could disturb to their depths his inmost thoughts. Ethel was so unlike her mother, that by degrees he became reassured; her eyes, her hair, her stature, and tall slender shape, were the reverse of Lady Lodore; so that in a little while he ventured to raise his eyes to her face, and to listen to her, without being preoccupied by a painful sensation, which, in its violence, resembled terror. It is true that by degrees this dissimilarity to her mother became less; she had gestures, smiles, and tones, that were all Lady Lodore, and which, when discerned, struck his heart with a pang, stealing away his voice, and causing him to stand suspended in the act he was about, like one acted upon by magic. While this mute and curious examination was going on in the minds of Ethel and her visitant, the conversation had not tarried.

Truth compels me to say, that nei- ther the most affectionate behaviour towards herself, nor the most guarded conduct to Augusta on the part of St. Aubyn, nor the frequent endeavours she herself made to repel every suspicious thought, could restore to Catherine that untroubled peace of mind, and entire confidence in her husband's love which had rendered her residence at C hitherto so delightful and so happy. Augusta was that heartless, inhuman being, who, even as a wife, had no triumph so great as that of practising upon the vanity (it would be unwor- thy to say the hearts) of men. St. Aubyn was still her mark ; and, though he forbore to offer her the pointed attentions she endeavoured to excite, she put it almost out of his power to address her with the merely polite civi- lity he was desirous ofextendingtowards her, by the footingof familiarity on which she seemed determined to receive him. The most steadily governed mind would certainly sometimes have been shaken, by the attempts she levelled against its peace; how much more, then, was that of the unfortunate Catherine disturbed ! The gaiety of her disposition — the sweetness of her temper, which, though from the vivacity of her undisciplined feelings subject to hasty ebullitions of anger at untoward circumstances, had still been of that affectionate kind, which rendered her to St. Aubyn the most attractive and engaging- of women — all was fading away — and, insensibly to herself, she was daily yielding to an irritability of mind, which betrayed itself at first in snch trifles as St. Anbvn considered it unworthy to notice ; but which gradually strengthened into a sort of conduct, which it was impossible for him to pass over without comment. Wishing as much as possible to avoid the presence of Augusta, whom she detested with a hatred which no prin- ciples within her taught her the sin of indulging, Catherine had evaded as often as she could, under a plea of indispo- sition, the frequent invitations she and her husband received from the Elliots.",alex

There was a candle on the chimneypiece, and another in a stable lantern near the window. Madame was conversing volubly on the hearth, with her face toward the window, the entire frame of which had been taken from its place: Dickon Hawkes, the Zamiel of the wooden leg, was supporting it with one hand, as it leaned imperfectly against the angle of the recess.
