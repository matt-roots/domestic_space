3,"It seemed a dream — a vision, which could have no truth in it ; and yet it came back and back upon him with an awful sense of all its consequences. Was not the love itself rash, mad, hopeless '? Had not the avowal of it been wrong, base, ungrateful 1 What would Mr. West wood think — he who had loaded him with kindness — he who had fostered, with such tender- ness, his youth, promoted his views in manhood, interested himself in every turn of his fate — what would he think, when he found that the child of his bounty, the son of the simple village carpenter, had raised his eyes to his daughter, had used the ad- vantages which the bounty of himself and his family had bestowed, to win her love, and perhaps to darken all the prospects of her future life 1 Bitter — bitter, was his self reproach ; but it was nothing to his despair. To hope was mere frenzy: he knew it well and yet what could he do? He could not fly. He was too weak to go immediately. He had promised to remain, even if he had been strong enough ; and had he not done so, could he leave Mary to despair like his ?",jessica

"" Better ! — it's j^erfect.

18,"Shall it be * Gin a body ' or ' Huntingtower ' ?"" she asked meekly ; and nobody volunteering a decisive opinion, she chirruped the former coquettish little ballad, and put a stop to social intercourse for exactly four minutes and a half. After that evei^ing Mr. Stuart knew who his rival was, and with what kind of influence he had to contend. An author, a musical man, a genius ! Well, he had very few weapons with which to fight such an antagonist, he who was neither musical, nor literary, nor gifted with any of the graces which recommend a lover to a sentimental girl. But he was a man, and he meant to win her. He admired her for her frank young prettiness, so unsophisticated and girlish, and for that perfect freshness and truth- fulness of mind which made all her thoughts trans- parent. He was too much a man of the world to ignore the fact that Miss Kansome of Mapledown would be a very good match for him, or that such a marriage would strengthen his position in his aunt's esteem.",jessica

D'Arcy had really taken pains to secure every comfort for her. She had a carriage at her command, and his servants were taught to respect her as their undisputed mistress. He endeavoured to make her preside at his table, and wished at once to introduce her to all his male friends — but this she refused. Abroad, she obliged him willingly in this particular, but in England, where she had once been so well known, Violet shrunk from such an ex- posure — for such she deemed it.",jessica

He answered it, however, without any change of countenance, l:)ut Avith a grave solemnity that made her again look at him curiously. ' Yes,' he said, ' I do hold that opinion, under great reserve.

The check was instantly pulled. — Alcibiade in a moment was at the carriage door, and the next, Lady Bubble and her laro^e green fan were moving slowly and with great dignity towards the unconscious pair. Sir Romulus having as- certained to his perfect satisfaction, that he had incurred no breakage in the fall, was beginning, with great benevolence to think of the safety of his companion, which he evinced by the follow- ing question — '' Well, my dear, and how do you feel ?"" "" As every wife must, sir, at so scandalous and immoral a scene !"" exclaimed Lady Bubble, advancing with the aid of a tragedy queen, flourishing her closed fan, as the ghost does his baton in Hamlet ; and then suddenly placing it as a barrier between the hay-coloured mous- tache of Miss Tripe, and the "" celestial rosy red"" of Sir Romulus's ample and glowing cheeks ; which, from his recent unwonted ex- ertions, now blazed and shone, like the jewel of the Philippine Isles, which Camilla gave Gil Bias. •' My dear, my dear,"" said the baronet, with his usual presence of mind, "" you have no idea of the danger we have been in ; you should have seen us just after our fall.""

The first glimpse which she caught of the sea of faces that were raised towards the plat- form on which she stood, caused her heart to sink within her ; but nature had gifted her with strong nerves, and a certain amount of inherent pride supported her throuo^h the first ao;itating; moments of her entree. But it was to the reception which her beauty gained her that her triumph over natural shyness was due, for loud and long were the plaudits which greeted her ears, and before she had given utterance to a note, flowers from the buttonholes of the smoking audience were freely showered on the stage.",jessica
63,"Henry, in mmd, was twenty years Bob's senior, at least; this one had been borne down by no calamity — had felt no pinching want — that one had been schooled by bitterest experience to look more seriously upon the affaire of life. Henry had many self- imposed responsibilities, (fetters that elevate manhood and give an earnestness to every action,) Bob's sole care was the due exercise of his darling art. It was no wonder then that there was a wide difference in their respective pursuits and opinions.

"" Well might he call you one of a thousand,"" said Bohun ; "" but if he who has not seen you says that, can you wonder at and upbraid my enthusiasm ?"" The lady was desirous of turning the conversation, and casting her eyes on the bed, where some letters were lying open, said, "" Have you any good news to tell me r "" Yes, there is a pleasant letter from Foster, saying that my darling Clara and her infant and my mother are all going on well, but anxious to hear from me again. Then there is a letter from an attorney at York, enclosing two letters from counsel who are to conduct a cause before me in which I am appointed arbitrator. Pray read all the letters, if you please.

73,"It will be the proudest day of my life, whatever it may be of theirs/ replies the enamoured Bobby ; and then Miss Monta- lambert is summoned and introduced to Betha's Jicmce, and the three sit down to breakfast together, and one at least is su- premely happy. But that one is not Betha. She never asks her lover what are his plans or pro- spects for the future. She is content to know that he considers himself pledged to her, and that Sir Willoughby and Lady Frere and the Matthews' will, in due course, be informed of the fact, and see that her personal influence and attractions have had the power to out- weigh all other considerations. It is some relief to Betha's revengeful inclinations to feel that she has succeeded in falsifying the prophecies of her late hostess, and proving that she did not tell a falsehood in order to glorify herself. As soon as Bobby Frere has taken his departure she is naturally subjected to a great deal of * chaff ' on the part of the lively Miss Montalambert ; but it is much easier to bear than it would have been, had her heart been really concerned in the matter.

But Patience watched his rather anguished expression with an unmoved face, and merely repeated her declaration. '' Yes — he had mentioned it before you came,"" she said. '' He had mentioned it more than once — very seriously. It's a curious thing, but it seems to me that one human being never can predict what will most powerfully affect another.",jessica

'* But all that was child- ish sport, and it passed away. I do not know how it was with mv master when she died, for he never came near us then, and he has never been here but once since. We heard he was quite beside himself, as it were. To be sure, he must have been very sorry ; and that was the reason, I suppose, that he did not attend the funeral. It was no want of respect or love either, I am sure ; but he has not such a lofty mind as Lady Rachel, and it would have killed him to have seen tliat sad ceremony."" """,jessica

98,"Before the altar was a pyramidal green stone, ending in a point, about five spans high, on which the victims were laid, one after the other, on their backs, to be sacrificed. During the whole time perfumes from the incense tree, and other fragrant plants, were burning; — and the groans of the infants, for the older persons seldom suffered a sigh even to escape them, were suppressed hy a sort of low chant from persons appointed, who all the while spinning round, wounded their flesh with lancets made of shells, and spurted the blood upon the kings feet. '7 The chief priest, or topzlm, held in one hand an idol with green eyes, saying to the purport, i ' This is your god."" He wore upon his head a crown of green and yellow feathers; he had his office by inhe- ritance •, he had gold rings with green stones in his ears, and under his lip, about the middle of his chin, a little pipe made of blue stone, his face daubed black. The other five priests wore wigs very much curled, with leathern thongs wound about them, girt in the middle of the head, and small paper tar- gets on the forehead. The hearts of the sacrificed were presented to the idol.",jessica
103,"Both the latter were in a bad temper this morning, with the early rising, the bill, the rain, and the cloak-straps ; even Fero had wept, and would not come near his aunt, who looked to him as the sweet drop in a bitter cup. But in a sloppy and smutty corner of E 2 LIBRARY UNIVERSE OF ILLINOIS the deck, Mayne came to her. His heart was full of bitterness too ; for he could not regard himself as either a faithful lover or a martyr to duty ; still, if there was another look to be had at Cordelia's bonny face, no small thing should stand in his way. ' So you have shipped yourself all aboard of a ship, and found the most uncomfortable place in it.' ' I shall have it to myself.

He was touched by the straightforward manner in which she had made her little ex- planation, though it seemed to him helplessly inadequate. If he stayed on, as he almost thought he would stay, for a few days, he resolved to devote himself to shaking Xorma out of these petty and narrowing trammels ; he could not but remember how in old days she had turned to him very eagerly, and lie told himself that he was now more fitted than then to be a guide. But for the present he let the matter drop, in spite of one or two sarcastic remarks from Lucy upon her sister-in-law's un- expected disclosure.

' I am scarcely the dupe you take me for,' he said ; ' if you really thought I spoke in good faith your shame and terror would be tenfold mine. You would urge me for our mother's sake to save the name you bear from public disgrace, and double your bribes for my expatriation. Own it ! You have married lately — was that an honourable thing to do ? ' '",jessica
228,"Thus did the demons of despair Her wildered sense to madness strain, Thus did her impious clamours dare Eternal Wisdom to arraign. She beat her breast, her hands she wrung, Till westward funk the car of light, And countless stars in air were hung To gern the matron weeds of night.

233,"I shall need all your help."" My dear Anne laid herself down, and smiled her sweet smile of content. She loved to think herself of use, and as for me, I loved to make her smile. *^ I must find my spectacles, Anne.

The Doctor came the next day, as he had promised, and every day for many weeks longer. He was paid by the year for attending the school, so his visits cost no extra charge, and her pupils took care that no comfort should be wanting to ensure their teacher's recovery. It was slow, and for a long time doubt- ful ; but in the midst of her sufferings there came to Miss Jones new and unsuspected revelations of love and gratitude that glad- dened her heart, and sweetened the bitter cup she was drinking so resignedly. From her English pupils she had always met with respect and consideration, there was nothing very strange in their redoubled kindness now that she was ill and espe- cially dependent on them ; but that those rough, unruly French girls who had spared no pains pour lui /aire la vie dure as they expressed it, should come flocking at all hours, full of affectionate anxiety, to inquire for her, this was more than she had looked for.

I was about to reply, when a loud, ap- palling crash of thunder rattled above us, as if some huge building had suddenly fallen into ruins. It startled us all into silence for a moment, and we looked into each other's faces with a certain degree of awe. "" That was a good one,"" remarked Mr. Challoner. "" There was nothing undecided about that clap. Its mind was made up."" Zara suddenly rose from her seat, and drew aside the window-curtains. "" I wonder if it is raining,"" she said.",jessica
