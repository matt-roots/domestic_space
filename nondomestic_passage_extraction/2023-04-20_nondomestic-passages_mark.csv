1,"How power- fully do the early associations of music recall the scenes and friends of our childish days ! Do you re- member those simple lines, Mifis De Cardonnell.^— * My eyes are dim with childish tears, My heart is idly stirr'd. For the same sound is in mine ears Which in those days I heard !' "" Emily repeated to him some stanzas from Leyden\s beautiful Ode to Scottish music, and enchanted by the beauty of her recitation, he begged her to try to re- member some more verses. "" I remember only another,"" she said, "" which alludes to the Hindu belief that earthly music recalls to our memory the feelings and recollections of that Paradise which they believe our souls enjoyed in a state of pre-existence.

6,"that he had lost his senses ; he thought it would be better to leave him to recover himself; he began to think that the next morning he should find him more reasonable. There was not much time to be lost : the trial would come on in abouc three weeks ; but one single night lost could not be of much importance. So he deliberately took up and closed his silver inkstand^ folded his paper, and placed them both in his pocket, still looking at Henry all the time. He now, under the various alternations of extrence misery, had sank into his chair again quite ex- hausted. The momentary irritation of his goi)d old friend had been but the anger of a moment : he said now, as kindly and soothingly as ever :^ '^ I see, my dear sir, that this agitating day iias really been too much for you.",mark
11,"His, firmness excited at once her anger and her admiration. She could not believe that she had heard his words rightly. She sat down to recall mi- nutely every circumstance of what had just passed, every word, every look; she she finished, by persuading herself, thafc his calmness was affected, that the best method she could possibly take, was by a show of resistance to bully him out of his indifference. She little knew what she hazarded : when the danger of losing her husbands love was imaginary, and solely of her own creating, it affected her in the most violent manner ; but now that the peril Was real and immi- nent, she was insensible to its existence. A celebrated traveller in the Alps, advises people to imagine themselves walking amidst precipices, when they are safe upon smooth ground ; .and he assures them that by this practice, they may inure themselves so to the idea of danger, as to prevent all sense of it in the most perilous situations. The four and twenty hours passed: and at the appointed moment, our he* rome and her husband met",mark
16,"Lord Dorimont thanked honest Jack, and assured him that he had lived too long in the world to be done by twenty Sir Harrys, but that he should bear the hint in mind, and act accordingly. The dinner was ordered at eight, but the worthy Baronet still continued his old pur- suits, and was as punctual to his engage- ments as ever, so that it was nearly ten o'clock before he made his appearance, and called for dinner. The party consisted of six, amongst whom were two great cronies of his, desperate hard drinkers, who were engaged to ply our hero so as to make him jolly, if possible ; they acquitted them- selves very well, but Lord Dorimont was on his guard. When they thought that he seemed some- what flushed, they proposed a little chucker hazard, and a box and dice were produced. They began to play heavy stakes amongst themselves, but neither Jack Smith nor Lord Dorimont would bet any of the party, only backing their own hands. Sir Harry saw it was no use to persist, and pretending to vote private play a bore, with an assurance (it was the height of as- surance) that he could not bear to win money of his friends, he suggested going to a hell to finish the night, but neither to Hookey's nor to the Milton ; he therefore took the party to a hell in King Street, well deserving of that name, if ever there was a hell upon earth : the gang was composed of broken- down gamesters, bankrupt tradesmen, and the very dregs of society, and off-scourings of the town. The stranger party made no small swell ; seats were provided for them, and every mark of distinction was paid them.",mark
21,"Httle real strength his fatigue and pain had left. He leant against the wall, faint, panting, without the power to move. A light near him shone into his eyes ; he was not able even to raise his head to discover what it was. And yet they were near . . . they would be coming ; they would catch him at last. With a great effort he raised his head towards the light. It was a lantern hung over a green door in the wall, no doubt intended kindly to relieve the darkness of the lane.",mark
26,"She vv'as an orphan ; and even in childhood blessed, or cursed, as fortune should decide, with that irresistible beauty which so often dazzles judgment, and confounds even wisdom. Lady Montague had been the saving angel of her mother ; who, though educated in the highest and happiest hopes, finally reverted to this dear, and once humble friend, as the sole j^rotector of her child ; nor was the appeal fruitless even when the heart that made it ceased to beat ; since to cherish the little Clara as a wife for one of her own sons, was among the few romantic projects which Lady Montague ever formed. The over- whelming succession of calamities that swept both mother and children to one common grave, left to Sir Arthur the painfid task of restoring Miss Rochford to those who were called her natural friends. lUit he had soon too much reason to regret having given up his lovely charge. Under the roof of her aunt, Lady Selina, the sweet child "" learned to sigh ere she could know to sin ;"" and was finally, by a concurrence of events, returned to the guard- ianship of the good baronet, with an earnest request that he would place her, for a small stipend, under some respectable protection in the country, llnppy was the day of her emancii)ation to the little Clara, who, in the bosom of nature and solitude, had early acquired those simple tastes and warm aftections which, with a moderate degree of cultivation, give mind its best character, and life its truest zest. In receiving her again to his protection, Sir Arthur was not, however, quite satisfied that he acted wisely. With the indecision, therefore, common to bounded minds, he attempted to find a medium where judgment would have told him that there could be none : and confining his pre- cautions to the simple one of removinor her from his own roof, he encouraged the hope that time and chance, if not the early return of Mr. Cavendish, would wholly separate her from Montague.",mark
31,"Sir John had not been in Paris for thirty years, and consequently found it had altered. The French are not a nation to stand still, or remain stationary either in science, art, manufactures, or architecture; on the con- trary, they are what the Americans call ""go-a-head"" — that is to say, they do not hold the "" what-was-good-enough-for-my- grandmother-is-good-enough-for-me'' theory, which I hold to be a most pernicious and preposterous one. The day after his arrival in Paris, Sir John had left cards at the English Embassy. He knew Lord Mountchessington in former days, and felt no scruple in claiming his ac- quaintance. His maxim was, never to suifer an ac- quaintance who might be useful to relapse into a stranger, or a friend to fall into the position of an acquaintance. "" You never know when you may want them,"" he used to say; ''and some people are so con- foundedly high and mighty, that they pretend they don't recognise you just at the moment you do want them."" Before he succeeded to the baronetcy he had plenty of experience of this sort; men who had made their way did not see any particular use in knowing John Fenacre; so, accord- ingly, they did not know him.",mark
36,"Then I'll take en back with me,"" said Mr. Brown; ^^and when danger threatens, he shall have the same quarters he had to- day."" The tears rolled down Edith's cheeks as he said thisj but she was silent. She then tried to dry her moistened countenance, that she might receive Eichard with an appearance of composure, and she succeeded in doing so ; but when he arrived, in spite of her efforts, another outburst followed. The recollection of his danger overpowered her. He caught her in his arms, and, greatly moved by the agitation of his wife, he held her to his breast. Not a word was uttered. The grief was too pro- found for interruption.",mark
41,"I knew no language strong enough to express my reprobation of her conduct ; and, yet, had I honestly looked into my own heart, and examined my own conduct, I should, perhaps, have found myself much the worse of the two. But this was what I never thought of. It required deeper humiliations and greater sufferings to awaken in me a real desire for amendment of life. The pangs I now felt were merely those of wounded self-love, ^s clearly appeared from this : that instead of pausing in my career^ I only diverted my passions into a new channel, and went on quite as recklessly as before. With all Ann's art, she failed to conceal from me, the fact, that in motives and conduct she differed very little from her mistress. Over parts of her narrative there hung a deep mystery ; yet, inadvertantly, and obviously against her will, she made me sensible that Doctor Crick had played a more important part than I imagined in the Leigh family.",mark
46,"I will I And when I say I will it is useless for thee to say ' thou wilt not ' — that thou knowest. Come, leave the fire, and bare that honest breast of thine that I may see the secret there. Come ! show' the cards."" "" I have none to show,"" he snarled, cowering still closer to the fire. Her eyes flashed for a moment, and the soiled fingers tightened round the thick stem of the glass. "" Idiot ! "" she hissed, leaning over the table till her wine-stained breath came hotly against his hair. "" Idiot ! Wilt thou leave me to find it out and take my own and thy share too .? Idiot ! Am I blind, thinkest thou, or as great a dolt as thyself that thou hug'st thyself with the belief that I do not know that thou hast found him ! """,mark
51,"Whoever thou art,"" then replied the wounded man in faint murmurs, and scarce making an effort to look at the person who ac- costed him, "" respect my condition. If thou art a Scot I must needs be thy prisoner."" "" I am no Scot,"" answered Raimond, much struck by the voice, ^' and if I were, honour and humanity would forbid my touching thee save with the hand of help."" "" Succour then an English knight, sore stricken in doing service to this ground,"" returned the suffering cavalier. "" Gracious Heaven ! I should know thee ! "" exclaimed Farneley, scrutinizing the person and equipment of the knight, for from his bending posture he could not see his face. "" Very Uke,"" he rejoined, "" the name of Rafe de Neville is neither unknown, nor his presence rare in gatherings of the March."" "" The knight of Raby !",mark
56,"Wigsby's friends — chiefly the wives and daughters of the great commercial planets of the neighbourhood. Mrs, and Miss Forge, the wife and daughter of the proprietor of the greatest iron-works in that part of England; Mrs. Pugsby, with whom the reader is already acquainted; the four Misses Tittups, whose father was at the head of the firm of Tittups and Co., railway contractors; Mr. and Mrs. Wellington Popkins, the former the secre- tary to the Great Diddleton Railway; and Mrs. and Miss Tims, the wife and daughter of the eminent Mr. Timothy Tims, the junior partner in the Diddlcton Bank. Mr. and. Mrs. Wigsby busied themselves by visiting the different groups at the several windows, looking extremely amiable, and their conversation, to a very remarkable extent, par- taking of the amiability of their looks; but it was clear that whatever respect they might have had for the majority of their guests, it was very far behind what they thought proper to display towards their distinguished friends from Welby Park. Their general air and manner towards Mrs. Snobson were characterised by a degree of ser- vility which would have sickened a less strong stomach for flattery than that which happened to be the property of the lady of the popular member. Mrs. Snobson, however, seemed to find it agree with her; she took her attentions with a proud consciousness of her own superiority, and made it appear as clearly as possible that she was dis^ playing immense condescension in affording her countenance to ""such people."" "" Miss Snobson !"" exclaimed her mother, im- periously, "" I wont have you hold your head in that wa}^, and twiddle that bit of string over your fingers.",mark

CHAP, IT was juft twilight when they arrived in th$ valley : they proceeded to the bower, where, ac- cording to a prior determination, the Baron and Donlfidor remained with the horfes, while Father Thomas, the officer, and Alphonfo, went to the chapel.

''That is Mrs. Burke, the wife of Colonel Burke, whom you saw out there under the stairs."" What ! wife of the man who was flirting so busily with Birdie. Though little Miss Dimity said nothing, while her eyes were tlius opened, slie knew by something in his voice, so fine it could hardly be given a name, that the same thought was in the mind of the quiet man beside her. But up came Lee towards her gaily — banishing reflection.",mark
71,"Sur- prised by such a sound, at such an hour, he shouted to know who was there. There was no answer, however. The silence was com- plete, tomb-like. Concluding, therefore, that he was mistaken, he hurried to pick up a big block which lay at his feet, and turned to descend. He was in the act of doing so, when again, and this time unmistakably, he heard the sound, and turning, quick as thought, looked up into the misty vault. For an instant — only for an instant — there was the outline of a head ; the outline of a gun; then a flash, and the next moment a stinging, numbing, indescribable pain right through the middle of his chest caused him to drop the stone which he had in his hands, and with a wild cry, in which pain, indigna- tion, and bitter unsj)eakable astonishment all seemed to mingle, he dropped down upon the ledge where he was standing, while a sound of footsteps, first nearer, then further, further, further, sounded overhead, finally dying away in the far-off solitary distance. The murderer had effected his escape.",mark
76,"An early hour was appointed for starting the next morning, and the party separated in great good humour with each other. As they were going down the steps, however, Captain Dono- van followed the two guests, exclaiming, "" Major Brandrum, allow me to speak with you for a moment ;"" and while the major paused at this summons, Reginald walked slowly on into the park. "" Thank you, my dear captain, thank you ; I never borrow money. It is always unplea- sant to borrow, and often inconvenient to pay ; and not the less inconvenient because it is unpleasant, nor the less unpleasant because it is inconvenient."" Such were the words which, spoken in Major Brandrum's voice, reached the ears of Reginald as he walked on. A moment or two after he was joined by his friend, the Ravenous Crow, who said, laughing, "" Hang the fellow ! he wanted to lend me money.",mark
81,"The girls will be thirsty for the rest of the evening,' Miss Minerva persisted ; 'the girls will have no appetite for the last meal before bedtime. And their mother will ask Me what it means.'

96,"No sound save the low mvrmvr of the old man's voice and their slow footsteps sell upon their ear, no human being was visible, no bird or bat disturbed the quiet air ; all was strangely, solemnly still, impressing, unconsciously to thern, a feeling al- most of awe upon both Quintin and Flors. The latter had descanted fervently upon the sweetness of his child, and had paused as though to enjoy the luxury of thoughts which the subject had raised — thoughts which had no words, a communion with the heart which had no audible voice. To Quintin such a pause was equally desirable ; he too could dwell upon the subject with an eloquence of thought no langvage could reach. It was even in this moment of attraction that a strange hand was laid upon the shoulder of Flors. He started from his reverie, and, in the deep shadow of a pillar which he was just passing, there stood a fi- gure of a man habited in black, with his face masked. In a deep hollow voice he exclaimed, while his hand still grasped the painter's shoulder, "" Michael Flors I"" Quintin was also roused from his dream of bliss by the sudden cry of astonishment which the old man made, as well as the exclamation of the stranger. Upon the impulse of the surprise he clapped his hand to his sword, and, at the same moment, his arm was seized and another voice of a similar tone exclaimed loudly — "" Quintin Matsys !""",mark
101,"Good-night,' she said once more to Brunt, who shambled away on his road to Haltham. And then, with a slight in- clination of the head, she was about to retreat again within her own little fortress. ' Mayn't I speak to you ? ' asked Hal Rushton. 'Of course,' she replied in a trembling voice, and he followed her into the room, though they did not close the door. 1 You are troubled to-night, I am sure. What has annoyed you ?

126,"The fort itself is a magnificent structure, well defended with broad ditches, and co- vered by a succession of works, on which many heavy cannon are mounted. But the circumstance which attracts, in a principal degree, the stranger's admiration, is the ex- ceeding care which is taken to keep it clean and well ventilated. Every day the sewers are washed out and sprinkled with quick- lime; while, ere sunrise, the sweepers are at work, not only as often as occasion seems to require, but much more frequently. More- over, the inmates of Fort William have other than human guardians of their health, so far, at least, as health is liable to be af- fected by the presence or removal of putre- fying garbage. Every body lias heard of the bird called the Adjutant, which walks about, respected, and therefore tame, and feeds upon carrion of every sort, from the body of the mouse up to the human frame, of which numerous specimens are, every tide, washed down the Ganges. A strange-looking creature he is — that Adju- tant — with his bald head and his ashen- gray wings, and his portly form lifting his bald head nearly four feet above the sur- face of the earth. And then, when the heat of the day comes, away he goes into the skies, ascending so far that you can observe only the shadow of his form in the sun- beam.",mark

Do you, Henry, endeavour to catch this spirit, and it will enable you to renovate the constitution of the church, according to the princicles on which it was first founded, and the whole world will then confess, what Saint Paul cJe- clared to the Athenians, "" That there is one God, Maker and Lord of all things; that he is not a local Being; nor delighted with the pomp of external worship ; that we are all his offspring, depend upon, live in him, and from him receive the daily blessings of his goodness; that in compassion to the ignorance of men, he gave them a particular revelation, and designed by the gospel to bring them to repentance, improve the moral perfec- tions, and promote the social happiness of mankind ; that he has appointed a time of universal judgment; and his Son Christ Jesus to be the judge, who will judge all mankind with perfect equity ; that Christ was slctin, sacrificed his life in the cause of truth, and thereby exhibited the noblest example of virtue, obedience, and good- ness; that he arose from the dead, and his resurrection is the evidence of his divine commission and authority bein* given to him ; that iiis worthiness pro- cured from God the keys of grace and power, to restore life to the numberless dead, and throui^h his coiisuinmate virtue we &hall be redeemed unto God, and live for ever in the heavenly world; if we attend to the rules of truth and wisdom, and in imitation of Jesus, so far as we are able; be willing to sacrifice our very lives and souls to the Will of our Creator, and the happiness of his creation.",mark
196,"George had come forth from Sir Simon's, having learnt what he, Trace, was then in blissful ignorance of. "" Why did you urge Paradyne to give up to me ? "" he asked of Mr. Henry. ""Knowing me now for Mr. Paradyne's son, you will understand how heavily that past calamity, entailed upon you, has lain on me. If I could but have wiped it off ! I was always thinking ; have atoned for it in any way ! And I could do nothing. It was but a slight matter for George to withdraw from the Orville.",mark
201,"‘Well—never mind; don't grieve,’ said Jude generously. ‘I did suffer, God knows, about you at that time; and now I suffer again. But perhaps not so much as you. The woman mostly gets the worst of it in the long run!’ ‘She does.’ ‘Unless she is absolutely worthless and contemptible. And this one is not that, anyhow!’",mark
206,"Montrose shrugged his shoulders. “And, like true champions in romance,” he said, “you have agreed, that you are both to worship the same mistress, as idolaters do the same image, and that neither shall extend his pretensions farther?” “I did not go so far, my lord,” answered Menteith —“I only said in the present circumstances,— and there is no prospect of their being changed,— I could, in duty to myself and family, stand in no relation to Annot Lyle, but as that of friend or brother—But your lordship must excuse me; I have,” said he, looking at his arm, round which he had tied his handkerchief, “a slight hurt to attend to.” “A wound?” said Montrose, anxiously; “let me see it. —Alas!” he said, “I should have heard nothing of this, had I not ventured to tent and sound another more secret and more rankling one, Menteith, I am sorry for you—I too have known—But what avails it to awake sorrows which have long slumbered!” So saying, he shook hands with his noble kinsman, and walked into the castle. Annot Lyle, as was not unusual for females in the Highlands, was possessed of a slight degree of medical and even surgical skill.",mark
211,"No fear of my forgetting it, my darling,"" he replied, as he fondly pressed her in his arms. "" I shall think of you both night and day, until we meet again. But meanwhile, what have I to give you in exchange ? There is nothing but my watch, and I shall want that on the voyage."" "" Hast thou not given me everything ?"" she answered, hastily, "" art thou not my very own ? Tell me so, Gor-don, before we part, say that thou art, wholly and irre- vocably mine, that no other woman can ever come betwixt thee and me, and for awhile I will be content to lose thee."" She gazed into his face, anxiously waiting his reply, with straining eyes that seemed as though they needs must wrest the truth from him.",mark
216,"My God ! ' he exclaimed, shuddering back from the kisses she was laying on his pale lips, ' this is more than I can bear ! Show me your way of escape, Sybil ; I will take it if I can.' ' Tell me the story of this mother and child,' she answered with desperate abruptness, ' and give me leave to clear your character in Mr. Helstone's eyes.' She withdrew herself from him as she spoke, and sank down again in the chair she had quitted, still keeping her eyes upon his face. Its expression of restrained feeling baffled her. She added, after a moment's pause, seeing that he remained silent ; ' There is no other alternative, Julian.",mark
221,"such brute beasts ! such stocks ! such stones ! that here we go on from day to day, enjoying the life he gives us, eating the bread and meat he gives us, drinking his good refreshments, resting upon his warm beds, and so on. . . . Every day, and every day, and every day — and who among us, I, most espe- cially for one, ever thinks, except maybe by scuttling through a few rigmarole words — ever thinks, I say, of thanking Him for it — of lifting up a warm, honest heart, of true real thanking, I mean ""i Of loving Him the better, and trying to serve and please Him the better — when he, great and powerful as He is — Lord of all the lords, emperors, and kings, that ever wore crowns and coronets in this world — condescends to let us thank Him, to like us to thank Him, and to take pleasure in our humble love and service !"" He paused — every eye was fixed upon the speaker. """,mark
226,"Amidst the harvest of death appeared a new portent. Men and women, who lightly rejected the Lord of life, threw away life itself as being no longer worth retaining, — a mere burden, to the endurance of which their philosophy, classics, and Jean Jacques brotherhood could not recon- cile them. The nobles, robbed of supremacy and privilege, did not die with a more cynical indifference or a more reckless defiance than did the philosophers and the women of sentiment. They thrust their walking-swords into their breasts like Roland, swallowed poison in prison like Con- dorcet, shot themselves like Barbaroux, or leaped madly into the Loire and the Rhone after their murdered relatives. In this cowardly fashion they cut the Gordian knot which perplexed them. Even the good men and women of France, who could not look upon life and death -with sneering contempt, came to regard them with dull apathy.",mark
231,"Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the bee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus.",mark
236,"The rest of the day passed with us all very pleasantly, and our conversation had principally to do with the progress of art and literature in many lands, and maintained itself equably on the level of mundane affairs. Among other things, we spoke of the Spanish violinist Sarasate, and I amused Heliobas by quoting him some of the criticisms of the London daily papers on this great artist, such as, ''J7e plays pieces which, thotigh adapted to show his wonderful skill, a7^e the veriest clap-trap ;' ^' He lacks breadth and colour;' ^^ A true type of the artist virtuoso'' etc., etc. '* Half these people do not know in the least what they mean by ' breadth and colour' or ' virtuosity ^ said Heliobas, with a smile. "" They think emotion, passion, all true sentiment combined with extra- ordinary teclmique, must be ' clap-trap.'",mark
241,"I never remember being as fond of any woman as I was of her. Matter of sense in reality, no doubt. Matter of intellect and taste as well, I nattered myself at the time. At all events I was in a very abnormal condition under her influence, as the sequel will show. The crisis came on in this way. We arrived one afternoon at Mainz, with the intention of sleep- ing there, and going down the Rhine by boat to Bonn the next morning, and McEwan and I privately made up a list of the phrases the painter would use about the scenery, and the castles, and the Lorelei and all the bag of tricks. McEwan had come into a lot of money, but was dressed like a tramp as usual, and was entertaining when he had something to drink, though I fancy he was a little victimised by the young woman Nellie, too.",mark
246,"She had neitJier liking nor disliking for him. He was an accepted fact in her life, and she never rebelled against what was unchangeable. Sometimes when she heard in society tlie praises of women given to his charming manners, his fascinating influence, his unusual charm, she smiled bitterly, knowing how self- ish and narrow and poor a nature that social charm concealed, how shallow was the amia- bility, how tainted with insincerity the appa- rent geniality, how brief and callous and valueless the swiftly passing passions of the man whom they adored. He was charming — when he was amused ; VOL. I, F he was kind — when it cost him nothing ; he was devoted — wlien liis devotion had the attraction of being also novelty and incon- stancy. But she knew well tliat this was all : that, at heart, no one on earth ever found in Avil- hon a single impulse that was unselfish, a single sentiment that was deeper rooted than vanity, or a single motive that was higher or more lasting than self-indulgence. When she watched him in the world with his graceful courtesies, his ardent homage, and his apparent munificence, it seemed to her that she saw the most pohshed perfection of high comedy. '",mark
