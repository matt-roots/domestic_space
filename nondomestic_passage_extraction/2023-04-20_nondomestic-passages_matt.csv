5,"Although Miss Biddy was daily pestered with accusations against her knavish ward, she determined not to credit a word to his dispa- ragement, especially as these were accusations not substantiated by evidence, which they could not well be, for he had never yet been actually and substantively detected in a viola- tion of the criminal code. He therefore pur- sued his career with the greater recklessness, whilst the idea of an absolute predestination to eternal life had so fixed upon his conviction, that he claimed to himself impunity from sin as a matter of divine and indefeasible privilege. Impelled by the confidence which such a con- clusion naturally awakened, he cast himself into all sorts of peril without once looking to the issue ; and to Erasmus's question in the colloquy of the soldier's confession, "" Do you never think what will become of your soul if you are knocked on the head ?"" he would no doubt have exclaimed with the murderous thane — "" I bear a charmed life !""* The venerable Miss Mackinnon, who had now attained a period of most respectable senility — for she was by this time fast verging upon seventy — though she became at times excessively peevish when the tricks of her ward were made the topic of discourse, dog- gedly adhered to her old conclusion that a pre- * Macbeth. destinated sinner must make an elected saint ; and, therefore, no matter to her how the dogs of the world, who had "" neither part nor lot'^ with him , represented his backslidings, she felt satisfied nevertheless, that he was perfectly secure of a communion with Calvin in the world of beati- fied spirits, where he would exult over the fall of Arminius and his three able defenders, Barnevelt, Grotius, and Hoogarbetz_, whom the Oudewater heretic had seduced from the sim- plicity of the truth, and involved in that ever- lasting doom which he had brought down upon himself.",matt

It was then to him that Augustin suggested their addressing them- selves. He had his reasons for thinking that Father Antonio would not refuse him, and he was deputed to confer with him . They then ascended the steep, and winding rocky road which led to the monastery. As they drew near to it, the voices of the monks rose in solemn chant for the midnight service ; and the sound rolled in harmonious diapasons past the startled ears of the ruffians, who formed themselves in a circle round the con- vent ; it havino- been decided, that if they failed in their request to the abbot, tliey sliould re- venge themselves immediately by destroying the convent, and murdering the monks.",matt

30,"There was something incongruous and inconceivable in the idea of the child of Cornelia a woman, married to his cousin. He feared to see in her an image of the being who had subdued his heart of hearts, and laid prostrate his whole soul; he trembled to catch the sound of her voice, lest it might echo tones which could disturb to their depths his inmost thoughts. Ethel was so unlike her mother, that by degrees he became reassured; her eyes, her hair, her stature, and tall slender shape, were the reverse of Lady Lodore; so that in a little while he ventured to raise his eyes to her face, and to listen to her, without being preoccupied by a painful sensation, which, in its violence, resembled terror. It is true that by degrees this dissimilarity to her mother became less; she had gestures, smiles, and tones, that were all Lady Lodore, and which, when discerned, struck his heart with a pang, stealing away his voice, and causing him to stand suspended in the act he was about, like one acted upon by magic. While this mute and curious examination was going on in the minds of Ethel and her visitant, the conversation had not tarried. Edward had never been so far south, and the wonders of Naples were as new to him as to Ethel. Saville was eager to show them, and proposed going that very day to Pompeii.",matt

40,"The poison of asps is under their lips, sir. I've proved it.' But there certainly was a tendency on the part of some to indulge in ungenerous criticisms concerning their neighbour's doings. Indeed, the atmosphere of Peckmore's seemed to have quite an alterative effect upon many of its patrons. Robert made the acquaintance of some, to all appearances, delightful people outside, who developed the most unexpected capabilities for maliciousness when once fairly in- stalled within. The disease took a dangerous form ; for whilst ignoring their own frailties, the patients im- puted the most selfish, discreditable motives to others. This certainly was a most singular phenomenon, and, not without alarm, did Robert contemplate how easily one could fall under the mysterious thraldom.",matt

Some new laws, some further constitutions of worship were to be added, or, as the family of Abraham were situated in the midst of idolators and unrighteous ones, it was foreseen they would soon fall from the essen- tials of religion ; and instead of preserving a right knowledge of God, of his being, perfections and go- vernment, a just sense of the reverence all men owe to him, from a firm belief of his being, power, domi- nion, justice, and goodness, and an hearty concern to obey the known will of God in all things ; doing what is pleasing in his sight, seeking, and hoping their perfection and happiness, in the likeness, and in the image of God ; they would, on the contrary, serve other Gods, and make their idolatry, not a matter of harmless speculation, but a fountain of the most dangerous immoralities ; and therefore, as it was highly fit in itself, and well becoming the wisdom of God, he gave Moses a Christianity in hieroglyphics, that is, a tabernacle, a shechinah, a priesthood, an altar, sacrifices, laws moral, and cere- monial, with every constituent part of the Hebrew ritual; being figures of a better shecbinah, temple, priest, altar, sacrifice, revelation, and blessings — figurative representations of the more perfect consti- tutions in the days of Messiah the King. This was in the year 875 after the flood, and in 1491 before Christ. By a ritual so becoming the wisdom of God, given for a preservative against idolatrous princi- ples, and as a dispensation preparatory to that future heavenly religion, the Hebrew nation were guarded against the surrounding corruptions of the world, and raised up the defenders of true religion, to pre- serve the knowledge and worship of the one true God. *'",matt

My father was going to urge something further on the subject, when a messenger D 3 arrived arrived from court, with dispatches from the king, informing us that Sebastian had been beset by banditti, and seriously wounded ; at the same time conveying a sarcastic message from donna Isidore, thanking me for the frequent visits I had lately paid her. I had been betrothed from infancy to this lady, who was of high birth, possessed of immense wealth, a fine figure, a tolerable share of beauty, a great stock of pride, and a tyrannical temper ; such was the wife, my father and the king, who had my interest much at heart, had chosen for me. It must be confessed, I bad not been the most attentive lover in the world, and certainly had given the lady some little cause of complaint; for supposing she must inevitably be mine, I did not think it necessary to trouble my head about her ; — such are the ill elBPects arising from parents betrothing their chil- dren in infancy!

"" Mr. Huntingdon's proceedings of late were open to every body in the hoose."" "" I depended on Huntingdon from Mr. Roberts's character of him — the old man had employed him many years, and had assured me that he examined his accounts every day, and never found him in the least fraudulent."" M I should just like to ken, how the de'el any mon could have an opportoonety to be fraudulent whose accounts were examined every day — I believe you never examined his accounts at aw."" This simple and obvious truth, had never occurred to Mr. Howel before, his blindness to it had been his ruin, and it now came so for- cibly upon his mind, that he struck his fore- head in agony. "" Haud yor hond, baud yor hond, Mr. Hooeel, you will find mickle good in going on in sic uncoo ways ; I did not mean to hurt your feelings, Sir, aw may be weel yet ; come, Sir, you don't do honor to my Fairintosh, and there is na other body this side the Tweed but yoursel, should have a sip of it— take another glass, Sir, take another glass.""

225,"He was avowedly an Irishman and a Romanist. I was prejudiced against the one — I was bigotted against the other ; and my aver- sion towards General Sarsfield became uncon- trolable-and unbounded. It was possible that time or a more intimate acquaintance with his character might have in- duced me to alter the feelings which unfavour- able first impressions had given birth to; but an incident occurred which fatally confirmed our mutual enmity. I was proud and tenacious of my manorial VOL. I. G rights. A pheasant having wandered from my preserve, was inadvertently shot by the gene- ral's favourite servant in his shrubbery.",matt

Francesca's tears fell fast upon the scroll, and some time elapsed before either could speak. Guido was the first to break the silence.

240,"His sloAV, quiet, yet firm footfall was known amongst those animals as well as their mas- ter's or Edgar Adelon's, and at two or three hinidred yards they had recognised it. After a moment's consideration, Filmer rang the bell gently, and the next instant Olive himself appeared with a light in his hand. He was fully dressed, and his face was grave and composed. "" Ah, father,"" he said, as soon as he perceived w^ho his visitor was, "" this is kind of you. Come in. Helen has not gone to bed yet.""

245,"The first volley of the Highlanders gave a tem- porary check to the enemy, and enabled the 34th and "" old Half-hundred "" to reform in order. The French hne was now, as I have said, within thirty paces, and every lineament and feature of their dark and sallow faces could be distinctly seen at so short a distance. They were now in the midst of all the uproar, the smoke, the blood, the danger, the min- gling of hideous groans and cries, — in short, the hell upon earth of a hot engagement, in which both parties became so heated by the slaughter around them, that all the softer passions were forgotten, and they longed, with a tiger-like feeling, to bury their blades in each other's hearts. Ronald felt his pulses thickening, the blood tingling in his ears, for the sound of the musquetry had deafened them to every thing else, and his heart rebounded within his bosom until he could almost hear it beat ; but it was with feelings the reverse of fear, — a wish to leap headlong among the enemy, to cut them down with his sword as he would whin- bushes, and to revenge the slaughter the terrible fire of so dense a column was making among his gallant and devoted regiment. So thick was the smoke become, that he could scarcely see the third file from him, and only at times it cleared up a little. What was then revealed, served only to infuriate him the more. The Highlanders were lying in heaps across and across each other, — piled up just as they fell ; while their comrades fought above them, firing and reloading with all the rapidity in their power, until struck by a shot, and down they fell to perish unnoticed and unknown.",matt
250,"John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, who governs in his youthful nephew's name, and whom we have most reason to dread, is at Eoxburgh, seeking to make a truce with the Scots. He 3—2 cannot return. Then the Earl of Cambridge is at Plymouth, preparing to set sail to Lisbon, with five hundred men-at-arms, and five hundred archers, to aid the King of Portugal against the King of Castile. The Earl of Buckingham is in Wales. Not one of the three is likely to interfere with us. "" There is no one to resist us, unless it be the King's half-brother, the Earl of Kent,"" observed Wat Tyler ; "" and he will not be able to raise an army, for the nobles hate him, and will not serve under him.""
