4,"Everyone ought to do their best to spare you.' * But I do not want to be spared,' returned Audrey, echoing her mother's sigh ; ' so please send Gage to me, and tell her not to stop too long. Crauford can tell her when tea is ready.' And then Mrs. Ross left her very reluctantly. Geraldine's face was suffused with tears as she sat down beside the bed and took her sister's hand. Audrey shook her head at her. * Gage, I don't mean to allow this ; you and mother are not to make yourselves miserable on my account.' ' How are we to help it, Audrey ?' replied Geraldine with a sob ; * I have never seen you look so ill in your life, and no wonder — this unhappy engagement !",svenja
9,"Sometimes she would talk wildly and laugh gaily ; but at others, she would sink into profound fits of thought, gaze forth into the vacant air, and answer questions quite astray. Even Lady Fleetwood seemed in a degree to feel the irritating effects of expectation. Once, in the middle of breakfast, without a word having been uttered regarding travels or travellers, she suddenly lifted her head, and said, "" I wonder at what hour they will arrive ;"" and some time afterwards, when walking for a moment on the terrace with Maria, she observed in the same abrupt manner, "" They will have a fine day for their arrival, at all events."" As the day wore on, and the hour at which they might be expected passed, Maria grew more thoughtful, more anxious, more grave; and Lady Ann, after watching her friend's face for a moment, said, "" Come Maria; this will not do. Let us go and amuse ourselves some way. We will walk down to the steward's, and see the hens and chickens, and talk about lambs, and be quite pastoral.",svenja
14,"La vieille nourrice de ma mère me répé- tait vingt fois le jour que tout ce que j'entreprendrais ne manquerait pas de réussir , parce que j'étais Sala- din-l'Heureux. Je devins présomptueux, téméraire, et ces pronostics flatteurs auraient eu sans doute une conséquence directement opposée aux intentions de le nourrice , si vers l'âge de quinze ans environ je n'avais pas eu le loisir de réfléchir sur ma folle pré- somption, durantune longue maladie qui en fut la suite. )y II y avait alors à la Porte un ingénieur français, intelligent et habile, qui avait un emploi auprès du Sultan , dont il était aimé , au grand étonnement de beaucoup de mes compatriotes peu éclairés. Le jour de la fêle du Grand-Seigneur , le savant français fit tirer de magnifiques feux d'artifice , que je courus Toir avec toute la population de Gonstantinople. Je réussis à m'approcher de la table où se tenait le Fran- jais ; la foule se pressait autour de lui, et moi j'étais aux premiers rangs. II nous invita, dans notre in- térêt , à nous tenir plus éloignés de lui, en nous aver- tissant que nous nous exposions à être grièvement blessés par l'explosion des pièces. Je me fiais à ma bonne fortune et ne pris aucune précaution.",svenja

29,"It was early on the following morning when the immense multitude of the insurgents surrounded the castle of Ermenonville; and, though the place was strong and well defended, yet before night terrible progress had been made towards its destruction. The walls were undermined in various places, and two or three more hours of light would have seen many a yawning breach in the defences. Just about the time that the sun was setthig, old Thibalt ]a Rue was seen speaking eagerly with four of the peasants, who had been carry- ing forward the attack on the side where he himself commanded. "" But I tell you,"" he said, in answer to some objection which one of them had seemed to make — "" but I tell you, that as soon as he has got possession of this girl, he will have al] that he has ever desired, and then he will marry her, get a promise of pardon, and distinction for himself, quit us, and leave us to our fate ; nay perhaps be the first to head the troops against us. No, no, we must enable her to make her escape, or else get hold of her ourselves, which would be better still ; for then we could rule him as we liked."" "" But how can we do it, how can we do it ?",svenja
34,"It seemed as if the water could not have come in at a better time than in the evening; when the pit was cleared of all the workers who had thronged it during the day. By-and-by a whisper passed round that the master and his son had been seen to go down an hour before, and that no one had observed them return. Mr. Franklyn was but little known and less liked among his work-people, but Rolla was regarded with a sort. of affectionate intimacy by everyone. The tidings of his danger spread with the curious suddenness with which ill news does fly out, as if it tingled from heart to heart quicker than words could convey it. The whole country seemed struck and dismayed at once, and no one exactly knew how the tidings first reached him. An hour after the water had broken into the pit, half the miners in the district were assembled on the Red Hill, and Arthur Yonge was making the most of the last half-hour of twilight, by setting them to work, some to draw the water away by letting down buckets into the pit, while others were endeavouring to repair the broken pumps so as to make them available for drawing off the water. Less than an hour after, the porters at the Little Combe Valley Station were going about their work with grave faces, and yet with an air of bustle and excitement that attracted the attention of the only passengers who got out at Combe from the late London train, though one of them was so great an invalid, as to make his descent from the carriage and his passage down the platform a matter of some con- cern to his companion.",svenja
39,"You are agitating me — dreadfully. I am not to be agitated. Doctor x\stley says so. I am not to be agitated.'

He looked at me for a moment, and then dropped into the arm-chair by him to the right of the fire.",svenja
44,"Good Heavens, Agatha, you are enough to provoke a saint ! here you are, engaged to one man, and under his very roof you amuse yourself reading and crying over the love- letters of another. Suppose, by any acci- dent, by any treachery, you were betrayed, and that that correspondence, or any part of it, fell into Lord Amesbury's hands. Such things have happened a hundred times to persons far more cautious and less reckless than you. Let me entreat you, since my authority avails nothing, to burn these letters at once."" "" I have said before that I shall do as I think fit with them.

Then he cries out suddenly again, seeing the agony in the face raised before his, ' Tell me, tell me who it is.' She sees, as in a dream, Loik go in and fasten the door, and put his back against it ; she sees Rohan's face become terrible in its anxiety, and she moans : 'They call him the Chouan chief — he thought to save you — he thought to save you.",svenja
64,"No, my dear, you're not to touch him ; don't lay a finger on him. The Lord be thanked — though God forgive me for thanking Him for the wicked- ness of any man ! "" How enigmatical this all was to Harry Gordon, and how little he could imagine any clue to the mystery, it is needless to say. Gilchrist herself thought her mistress was temporarily out of her mind. She was quicker, however, to realise what had happened than the young man, who did not think of the jewels, nor remember anything about them. Gilchrist looked with anxiety at her lady's white face and gleaming- eyes.",svenja
69,"I took particular notice of that.' * Any cress or mornagarm,' asked Higlett. ' No, there was nothing on the envelope ; but the paper was as thick as parchment. Whoever wrote that letter was quite the lady.' 'Ah,' said Higlett, 'Mr. Clissold's sweetheart, very likely.' ' That's what I've been thinking, and that it was that letter, perhaps, that took him off so suddenly, and that he really may have been far away from Eborsham on the night of the murder.' 'If he was, he'll be able to prove it,' replied Mr. Higlett, who was not inclined to entertain tlie idea of Mr. Clissold's innocence.",svenja
74,"Ay; but on that night, when I was shut up in the cathedral, on the bell tolling ' one,' did not a super- natural light make its appearance — and did not the or- gan, of its own accord, strike up ? and, then, did not the effigies of Cardinal Beaufort, Bishop Gardiner, William Rufus, and Inigo Jones, led on by the grim king of antics, commence the ' dance of death ?' and then "" Here the argument was stopped by the stopping of the coach. The disputants and other travellers having now arrived at the George Inn, Winchester, the foot- man descended with the impassioned orator, and con- ducting hirn towards the school, the debate was ad- journed to (at least) that "" day six months."" Having changed horses, the coachman proceeded on bis journey, which did not prove at all productive to our hero; for, except an original remark or two from an outside passenger (who pretended to be a great ad- mirer of scenery, and whose name was Pointblank, as be afterwards discovered), be beard nothing worthy of irwertuig in his memorandum-book. Vivid was complaining of the coarse, uncourteous conduct of those upstarts, as he properly called them, wbo make it a rule never to answer letters.

79,"Tlie fond motlier looked alternately at her children, breathing SO softly there, in peace and safety, then cast a hasty glance upon the well-known objects collected around. What had been her situ- ation some few hours since ? what was it now '? She prostrated herself in humble gratitude to God. Speak she could not, but her full heart poured forth its silent aspirations to the Throne of Grace. Words are but the vehicle of prayer, not its essence ; and the outpourings of a pious, humble, and grateful heart, are not less acceptable for being silent. Mrs. Darcie arose more comforted than she had felt for many days and many fearful nights.",svenja

89,"Adalbert had watched the fugitive, and at that moment would have exchanged a diadem for the posses- sion of the precious flower. He raised his hand to snatch it from its station, but the impulse brought reflection. He paused, fearful of betraying the secret of his feelings, although his eyes, to any other than Hosal the, must have disclosed the sentiments he struggled to conceal. I know not how long this scene conti- nued; nued ; it should have lasted for ever had it been in my power, for I would have perpetuated it on the canvas. A bell from the castle now summon- ed them to the festive board. Adelbert drew a hand of each through his arms, and hastened from the grotto. Thus did the hours glide swiftly away.",svenja
94,"She had now time to think over the strange- ness of the whole adventure ; and the pretended revelations she had just heard. She could scarcely give credit to them; but though strange, they were not impossible. She had been warned of the Hanoverians, both by the Prince and Princess, and was now ready enough to believe that they might have been led by jealousy or hatred to mark her out for destruction. Could her voice have reached Leicester House, she doubted not that amongst her numerous admirers it would quickly raise for her a champion as valiant as Prince Oroondates ; and, according to her ideas, never had a distressed lady greater occasion for the interposition of such a hero. Mary Lepel was not disturbed any more that day. Her silent attendant came and went, fetched and carried, scrutinized her closely, and watched her movements with cat-like vigilance ; but though her uneasiness had greatly increased, the prisoner contrived to get through the day with tolerable quietude ; and having taken the same precautions as on the previous night, she said her prayers, and resigned herself to sleep with more composure than might have been anticipated. In the morning of the third day of her abduc- tion the young heroine rose, greatly refreshed.",svenja

When Jerry O'Brien reached Kilbarry that afternoon, he drove straight to O'Hanlon's office, and briefly recounted to the astonished solicitor what he and Jim Phelan had seen at the Black Rock the day before. O'Hanlon was for a few moments speechless with amazement. When his amazement wore off a little, he found himself bound in on all sides with perplexities.",svenja

109,"Matilda heard a noise—footsteps were distinguishable, and looking up, a flash of vivid lightning disclosed to her view the towering form of Zastrozzi. His gigantic figure was again involved in pitchy darkness, as the momentary lightning receded. A peal of crashing thunder again madly rattled over the zenith, and a scintillating flash announced Zastrozzi's approach, as he stood before Matilda. Matilda, surprised at his approach, started as he addressed her, and felt an indescribable awe, when she reflected on the wonderful casualty which, in this terrific and tempestuous hour, had led them to the same spot. “Doubtless his feelings are violent and irresistible as mine: perhaps these led him to meet me here.” She shuddered as she reflected; but smothering the sensations of alarm which she had suffered herself to be surprised by, she asked him what had led him to the forest. “The same which led you here, Matilda,” returned Zastrozzi: “the same influence which actuates us both, has doubtless inspired that congeniality which, in this frightful storm, led us to the same spot.”",svenja

Just what she lacked Mrs. Haythorne possessed, though probably he should never have found it out, and Audrey might eventually have satisfied him, if the other more richly endowed woman had not come across his path, and so revealed to him what it was that he needed. So he would take Mrs. Hay- thorne's timely advice, and, whilst retaining Audrey Ferguson as a friend, wait for ful- ness of years and prosperity to bring him the wife he needed and would then de- serve.

119,"Lefevre when she received a visit from Teresa, whom she believed to be away in Eonen, superintending affairs at the hotel. The latter explained that she and Paul were taking a holiday, and that they were staying at Eixensart with some friends. The time had arrived, she con- tinued, in a mysterious voice, when Paul would redeem his promise, and would tell mademoiselle of her relationship to Philip de Ruthvyn. He had papers which were of immense value to her, but, as other people were mixed up in the affair, he could not give them without the greatest secresy and caution. After much de- liberation, she suggested that Fleurette should ask leave to spend a day in the country with her. Paul's sister, who kept the restaurant in the Ene Neiive, was pro- prietor of the principal inn at Rixensart, and if she met him there, he would be able to give her the papers, and tell her many things about Philip which were important for her to know. Fleurette listened with absorbing in- terest to all that Teresa told her.",svenja
124,"His heroic strength and bravery had rendered him extremely popular among the soldiery. He was naturally high-spirited and proud ; and it was not to be expected that he would tamely yield to indignity and public shame. His prowess and his courage were equalled only by his good fortune, so that his personal reputation was already very high. Born of noble parents in Tur- komania, he had spent his youth in Persia, having served with uncommon renown under Shah Ishmael the Third. His original name was Asta Jilho; but having slain a lion single-handed, he was digni- fied with the title of Shere Afghan, signifying the overthrower of lions. Under the latter name he had become both famous and popular throughout India, and in the wars of Akbur had served with great distinction. He had reaped a profusion of laurels under Kahn Kahnan, at the taking of Sihnd, by exhibiting prodigies of strength and valour.",svenja

Never since these letters had been first received, and read by Donna Aurelia in the days of her love, had they been perused with such feelings as now struggled in the breast of Theodore. Their contents made him acquainted with the events of his father's life, of his feelings, and principles. His heart felt its kindred with the deep tenderness of Don Balthazar's : for many of his own peculiarities of thought and of sentiment, did he trace in those of his father. That long-lost, almost unknown parent k 2 seemed once more to live, to act, to speak from these letters. As Theodore alternately glowed and melted over the alternate passion and tenderness addressed to his mother ; as he trembled with hope and fear over many of the hopes and fears expressed by his father, he could with difficulty convince himself that all this emotion, this struggle, this combat with the ills of life, this transport in the enjoyment of the affections, this dread of losing it, this sensibility to joy and sorrow, were all buried in the stillness of death. «* O no !""",svenja

She could not refrain from mentioning the matter at dinner that evening, though Edward had a little failed on the former occasion, in that backing up of all her opinions and feelings which she had been accustomed to expect from him. "" I find there is to be no match such as that we were speaking of,"" she said. ""Harry has either drawn back or he is refused. Perhaps it may be that he has thought better of it,"" she added suddenly, without premeditation, grudging, as perhaps was natural, to let her young antagonist carry off the honours of the day.

144,"The portrait, indeed, no longer represented' Dr. Joseph Chacomb. His face, lit by the can- dies, had lost its old red hue, and was now pale, but not pallid; his large eyes — formerly, to the young girl's fancy, so fierce — were softened and grave; above them lay eyelids heavy, as if with thought. His eyebrows were no thicker than is befitting to a man of great mental and physical strength. His lips were large, especially the lower lip; but you may remark the same pro- minence in that feature in the photograph of nearly every great statesman, lawyer, or preacher. His hair, grown thin at the temples, was strong, closely knitted, and not yet touched with grey — a sturdy crop of brown curls. His large hands, from vrhich he had removed the gloves, were now white and shapely. He was dressed by Poole, in such garments as belong especially to the prosperous physician — a black buttoned frock, and grey trousers in which no trace of Adie's ancient ""bulge"" was visible.",svenja

This is open to doubt.

Plus il la voyait, plus il admirait sa beauté, son intelligence, les aimables qualités qui lui gagnaient les cœurs, même dans la famille si divisée des Pecksniff, et qui, en peu de jours, avaient rétabli de toute façon un semblant d'harmonie et de tendresse entre les deux sœurs courroucées. Quand elle parlait, Tom retenait son souffle, tant il l'écoutait religieusement; quand elle chantait, il restait comme en ex- tase. Elle avait touché son orgue ; et depuis cette mémorable époque le vieil instrument, compagnon de ses plus heureux jours, qu'il n'eût pas cru capable de mériter un tel honneur, inaugura pour lui une nouvelle et divine existence.",svenja
224,"He had awoke from his first bewilderment, and began to un- derstand vaguely that everything was not going to be easy for him as he had once thought. "" You see I /lave spoken to her,"" he said. *' You frighten me horri- bly ; but then it is of no use considering what you would have done in a totally different case."" The Duchess sighed and shook her head. *' That is what I should have thought It my duty to say, in view of all the pain and confusion that are sure to follow.",svenja
229,"If I am to do this—and I don't half like it—I do it to serve you, although how it is to serve you is an impenetrable mystery to me. If you put it upon any other grounds, you must look elsewhere. I'll give my name cheerfully to oblige a friend—but I'm not the man to sell it for a consideration.” “You will acquit me,” replied Rawlings, “of intending what I said in that sense.” “Oh! of course—of course,” returned the captain. “The fact is, it is you who place me under an obligation, and I am willing to accept it from you upon no other condition than that you will command me in any way I can serve you in return.",svenja
234,"Good Lord ! what will that poor child say to the news of the war ? She is too tender for such times as these."" "" Yes ; she will not be so full of gay excitement as Mistress Anne Barrington,"" said Dick, stealing; a glance at his brother. "" Were we all chopped into mince-meat she would but say that it made life like a romance."" Joscelyn shrugged his shoulders. "" The novelty of war will soon wear off, and she will long for peace, or perchance, while the rest of the world is fighting, she will marry some cathedral dignitary."" """,svenja

244,"But he noticed with the quick eyes of love that her hands burnt as if with fever, that her usually pale face was flushed and hectic, and that her parched lips were dry. He noticed, too, when he took her in his arms and drew her to his breast with that tenderness, that infinite yearning of the unloved seeking to gain what is denied, that she visibly shuddered and drew her- self away as if she had been stung. He did not let her see what pain this mute repulse gave him. As gently, as tenderly as he had taken her did he now relinquish her ; but over all his inner being came the deadly sickness which men call despair — that anguish of impotent fury which would revenge itself if it could, and which cannot find the object.

249,"Then the moon, Hke a goddess Invoked, came forth from behind a bank of clouds, irradiatinof the whole scene, and casting a broad silver pathway on the water, whilst the great palaces on either side stood out against the shimmering sky, silent and dark in their strong shadowing. The music rose and fell ; the dense floating mass of gondolas increased in volume with every inlet of the canal. Some red and ereen Bengal lights flashed out here and there, with long trailing reflections, revealing the architecture of great water-gates, and iron trellised windows, from which came the sight of merry faces, and the sound of joyous voices. At last the Rialto was reached, and there, under the echoing bridge, the gaily- decked music-boats paused with their rock- VUL. I. 19 ing lanterns, and around them pressed the attendant black gondolas. "" Santa Lucia,"" sang an unaccompanied quartett, beginning the well-known melody that is as much loved in Venice as at Naples : *' Sill mare luccica L'astro d'argento, Placida e I'onda, Prospero e il vento,"" and, like a triumphant wave of joy, from all sides burst a mighty chorus.",svenja
