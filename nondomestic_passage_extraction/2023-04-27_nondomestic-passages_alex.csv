252,"Definitively then, you will not allow me to write to the minister?"" *^ If I permitted all my prisoners to write to his Excellency, his whole time would be lost in reading petitions, and / should deserve to lose my place. I have heard enough. '' "" One word more, Captain ! If the words of a honest man possess any value in your eyes, I swear to you that the honour, life, and for- tune, of the Count von Spulgen, as well as the repose of another whom I will not now name, are at this moment in the greatest danger ! If, this day, the minister do not get my letter, to- morrow he is lost!""",alex,,
257,"This reason cannot yet be mentioned— he had hardly revealed it to himself—it was deep down in his soul—to be or not to be—as circumstances, time, and the hour should decide. After having lived so long in retirement, our young hero, when he was to go into company again, had many fears, that his manners would appear rustic and unfashioned. With all these apprehensions as to his manners, there was mixed a large proportion of pride of character, which tended rather to encrease than to diminish his apparent timidity. He dreaded that people should value him, or think that he valued himself, for his newly acquired fortune, instead of his good qualities—he feared that he should be flattered—and he feared that he should like flattery. —In the midst of all these various and contradictory apprehensions, he would perhaps have been awkward and miserable, had he been introduced into society by one who had less knowledge of the world, or less knowledge of the human, heart than Sir Ulick O'Shane possessed. Sir Ulick treated him as if he had always lived in good company. Without presupposing any ignorance or any difficulty, he at the same time always took care to warn him of any etiquette, or of any modern fashion, so that no one should perceive the warning but themselves.—",alex,,

277,"The children appeared almost distracted; their grief had more of that stunning character which attends unexpected calamity, than of sorrow for one who is gradually drawn from life. At length the messenger entered the room, and almost choked with tears, stated that both priests were absent that day at Conference, and would not return till late. The hitherto moderated grief of the wife arose to a pitch much wilder than the death of her husband could, under ordinary circumstances, occasion. To die without absolution--to pass away into eternity ""unanointed, unaneled""--without being purified from the inherent stains of humanity--was to her a much deeper affliction than her final separation from him. She cried in tones of the most piercing despair, and clapped her hands, as they do who weep over the dead. Had he died in the calm confidence of having received the Viaticum, or Sacrament before death, his decease would have had nothing remarkably calamitous in it, beyond usual occurrences of a similar nature. Now the grief was intensely bitter in consequence of his expected departure without the priest.",alex,,
282,"Madame Duval was in ex- tacies; and the Captain flung himfelf into so many ridiculous distortions, by way of mimicking her, that he engaged the atten- tion of all the company *, and, in the midst of the performance of the Coronation An- them, while Madame Duval was affecting to beat time, and uttering many expreftions of delight, he called suddenly for faits, which a lady, apprehending fome diftrefs, politely handed to him, and which, instantly applying applying to the nostrils of poor Madame j_)uval, fne involuntarily fhuffed up such a quantity, that the pain and surprise made her i cream aloud.

This excuse by no means appeased her, and they had a violent quarrel -, but the only effect her anger had on the Captain, was to encreafe his diver- sion. Indeed, he laughs and talks so terri- bly loud in public, that he frequently makes us ashamed of belonging to him. Madame Duval, notwithstanding her wrath, made no fcrupie of returning to dine in 'Queen-Ann- street. Mrs. Mirvan had secured places for the play at Drury Lane Theatre, and, though ever uneasy in her company, she very politely invited Ma- dame Duval to be of our party -, however,, she had a bad cold, and chose to nurse it.

292,"Paul and Halliday retired into a small recess in the interior of the cavern ; they were soon joined by several mariners whose heads had been left untouched by the liquor-cup. The following con- versation took place, and the ears of Maud drank in every sound with an anxiety amounting to pain.

302,"they are re-united now. But how pitiful to think of that long life, filled with one maddening thought, one long waiting for the impossible, the whole of God's fair creation walled up and stifled in one crushed brain ! If one were to love like that — God forbid ! — it were better to taste death at once. But Gwen- doline's story had ever haunted me ; and, though I loved the terrace on a fine summer's morning or in the full glory of the afternoon, twilight always banished me from the spot.

"" You speak darkly,"" said Sir George — "" or else, I am reluctant to understand the meaning of your words."" "" I came not to speak in riddles,"" continued Caroline, in the same suppressed voice, "" when I came upon the errand that has brought me here. God knows what it is I do — but I am so very wretched, and the alternative to which I am bound is so very dreadful, that I may hope to be forgiven ! In this room, not a week since, you condemned, indignantly, the ' bar- gain,' as you called it, ' which bartered away the long happiness of a young heart, to gladden the cold passions of a selfish one !'

312,"“No, no, it is not man's nature. I will not allow it to be more man's nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or have loved. I believe the reverse. I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage, and riding out the heaviest weather.” “Your feelings may be the strongest,” replied Anne, “but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender. Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer-lived; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments. Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.",alex,,

' Pardon me, Missouri/ said Deverel, grasp- ing his hand; ^I will try never to form a wrong opinion of your actions again.' At nine o'clock in the evening the river began to rise with the tide, and there were strong hopes of getting the brig off. The mountain streams that fed the river had been swollen by the late storm, and the water rose rapidly. About ten o'clock, however, there was a fresh alarm of the approach of the blacks. The night was very dark, and the canoes were nearly alongside before they were discovered. The large guns could not be used, and the blacks were soon climbing the sides. , Lamps were burning over the deck.",alex,,
327,"How much of this outcry for gold did Mr. Craig think would be superseded by the customers of country banks being referred to the Bank of England for metal money, instead of having it of their own bankers ? ""As much,"" replied Mr. Craig, ""as the Bank may choose. It can proportion its issues to country bankers as it likes. But, in case of the adoption of this plan, it will be necessary that branch banks should be established by the Bank of England in all populous districts, so that the people may have every facility for converting their notes. Much less business would be done, much less confidence would exist, if there were delays and difficulties of any kind in converting notes which are convertible at all.""

Now"" and then our horses stumbled in the deep ruts made by the wood-wagons, and it was with difficulty we could force them forward. My companion seemed to manage better than I, and whipped his horse onward as if he were more famihar w^th the path or else more reckless ! I wondered at this without making any remark. After half-an-hour's struggling, we reached the angle of the rail-fence, where the enclo- sure ended and the woods began.",alex,,

347,"Ah ! had you lived, I should have needed no other protector,"" continued she, bursting into an agony of tears. In the miserable predicament in which she found herself placed, she saw only the alter- native of putting herself still more in the power of Briggs, by proceeding Avith him to Calgarth Hall, or accepting the protection of Philipson. The impropriety of this latter measure appeared to her so glaring, that cost what it would to her feelings, she determined to pursue her journey with Briggs, in obe- dience to the dying commands of her mother. The tumult below now increased to louder clamours. Her name was again and again repeated in louder tones. Presently she plainly distinguished the clash of arms, and the shrill accents of old Bridget and her attendant damsel, partly in terror and partly in supplication ; but while all this reached her from below, and her anxiety to hear plainly the subject of dispute became more intense, and caused her to hold her breath, lest her respiration should prevent her facility of listening, the harsh, angry voices sank to faint whispers on her ear, and she fell back upon her pillow in a state of utter insensibility.",alex,,
352,"It was not the first time Sidney Aschen- burg had had to listen to expostulations upon this subject from his guardian ; but he sat unconcernedly enough, tossing over his straw- berries, while a slight smile played about his mouth. There was a pause of several seconds, and then Mr. Aschenbursf, 'with the touch of as- perity gone from his voice and manner, said, ""Think well before you come to a decision upon anything ; but, having come to it, stick to it — unless, of course, there is some absolutely good reason for change."" Then, as if he felt he had been speaking with undue harshness, he turned for the first time to the young man, the old kindly smile in his eyes, saying, "" And now, my boy, go to Norway and have a pleasant trip, and let us forget there was any talk of change."" For the first time the unconcern depicted on Sidney's face gave way, and he looked at the elder man resolutely, his straight eyebrows knitting themselves, and the mobile mouth stiffening in a haughty determined way. "" You have been tutoring me to be reso- lute, therefore I need not apologize if I say once and for all that I shall not go to Norway."" Mr. Aschenburg did not change his position, but kept his arms on the table and leant over them, Hs face with its benevolent expression turned upon his companion. '*",alex,,
357,"Here, I thought, are two specimens of humanity without intelligence or education, who show the natural depravity of human nature and the great power my master possesses in this world. Here is a proof that in his original state man is but little removed from the demon. Not the slightest provocation had the engineer given those two idiotic murderers. They had not even envy or jealousy to stimulate them, their brute natures not being even sufficiently organized to allow such feelings. They would have committed a terrible crime, and that from the mere pleasure to be found in its perpetration.

The drunken pirate was led off to a couch composed of moss and dried fern, in another re- cess of the cavern. Soon after, Levi, who also was to pass this night in the rock, retired to his pallet, and composed himself to rest ; whilst Standwich and Cuthbert Mayne, and one or two others in their especial confidence, held a coun- cil as to the management of their desperate affairs, which, in due place and time, will be made known to the reader, since, whatever their determinations might be, it was not yet that they could carry them into action.",alex,,

387,"There was something so honest and good-humoured in the appearance of this man, that I fancied I might safely request his advice and assistance, in pro- curing the means of removing to some distant town. I invented a story of being- sent for to Bristol, to attend a dying re- lation, and found him intelligent and kind- hearted. He told me, that although Lon- don was certainly quite out of my way to Bristol, yet, he thought I was more likely to obtain a conveyance from that place than any other ; and said^ he had no doubt, he should meet with some friend at S 3 who would convey me to the metropolis. At first I felt averse to this scheme, till recollecting that I should find it much easier to conceal myself in London than in S , or any of the adjacent towns, I thanked him, and accepted his offer of endeavouring to procure me a safe and speedy means of continuing my jour- ney.

397,"V. 4. which has gone forth from the hps of immutable and everlasting Truth cannot be reversed or annulled, save by the destruction of the body. Thus, also, when it was thought to have in Ame- rica an episcopal, or apostolical, church, never did the people dream of making bishops (and without these there could be no ministry) ; but determined on applying to the Church of England. And our colo- nial establishments are thus preserved in the unity of the Church, under one Head and Lord of all — '* the Shepherd and Bishop of our souls."" But, though the dissenting ministry may not lay claim to the validity which characterizes the mission of our clergy, it may, nevertheless, be argued* from Scripture that it has a validity. The exceeding good- ness and love of our Lord has, it would appear, given a sanction to this sort of co-operating service, by which it is, in his eye, at least suffered, though probably with a regard for his peculiar followers, so jealous that it requires, in order that they may be efficient workmen, a hearty and sincere — not a schismatical and opposing spirit, to render valid the labours of such Christian ministers.

Fitzgerald, after fixing the reins to the saddle, undid the strap which held up the creature's foot, and allowed him to run loose, in order that, if disposed to buck, he might do so before being mounted.

The Indians don't say, as they ought, ^",alex,,
657,"Yet what man ever possessed so much glory as Jesus Christ? The whole Jewish nation predicted him before his coming ; the Gentile world adore him since his coming. Both Jews and Gentiles regard him as their centre. And yet who enjoyed so little of so much glory ? Of thirty-three years he spent thirty in privacy. During the other three he passed for an impostor ; the priests and rulers of his nation rejected him ; his friends and kinsmen despised him ; and at last he died an ignominious death, betrayed by one of his attendants, denied by another, and deserted by all. ""What share had he in this glory?",alex,,
662,"Indeed, if he hadn't chanced in upon me to-day I should have had to have sent for him to-morrow.” “Dear me,” said I. “Have they any children?” “Yes,” said he, “two; they are staying with one of my daughters at present, where, indeed, Clara has mostly been. I wouldn't lose sight of her, as I felt sure they would come together again: and Dick, who is the best of good fellows, really took the matter to heart. You see, he had no other love to run to, as she had. So I managed it all; as I have done with such-like matters before.”",alex,,
667,"Don't you think the gent had better get up in the field at the back of the yard ? "" asked Drinkwater, sidling up to his master. ""Who do you mean by the gent ? "" said Mr. Crackenthorpe. "" Why, the little gent in them curious breeches and boots,"" said Billy. "" No, I don't ; why shouldn't he get up here ? "" *' Cos it's so precious hard on these stones."" There was just one drop of the milk of human kindness left in Billy. """,alex,,
672,"Anne was startled and confused, but after standing in a moment's suspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away. Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs. Clay, were the earliest of all their party, at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires in the octagon room. But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone. Anne was the nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke. He was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle “How do you do?” brought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries in return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground. Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing of their looks, and felt equal to every thing which she believed right to be done.",alex,,
677,"A pale, grey lightening of the sky ; dim branches waving against it solemnly; clouds tinted witli yellow light, flushed — Morning ! Sunrise in the east, and the tide coming up, up, up, with a merry dancing motion on the level sands. But yesterday, Connie and I had risen early and wandered out on the cliffs to see the dawn upon the purple sea — to-day I lay shattered, mind and body, amongst the salt bracken and the night dews, having passed in an instant from the plains of life into the dark valley of the shadow of death. Then my heart seemed to break, and I prayed God that one of his ano-els miij^ht take me bv the hand and o-uide me through. XYI. A PRISONER POR LIFE. But I was not to escape yet.",alex,,

687,"In fact, she had not much to tell Cyrus — she could not speak of herself, lest she should betray sentiments for which he might contemn her ; and of her outward doings there was little to say. Uncle Manuel still continued ill, and she had, by her aunt's request, declined all concert engagements for the winter ; that sober respect- able woman would have had her pledge herself never again to appear in public, but Lola would not do this. "" If I am not to be happy, I will be famous,"" said she, in her heart ; and to deai^en her pain she resumed the study of the operas and plays which she had never quite relinquished, and told Cyrus in one of her short and rare letters that the ancient ambition of being an actress was returning upon her again strongly. In answer to this came an impetuous remonstrance from Cyrus ; "" modesty of her sex, outrage to feminine delicacy, unfitness,"" figured largely in his phrases ; for a friend he took too much upon himself, but it was clear that in his own mind he possessed a sort of proprietorship in all Lola's thoughts, designs, and doings; — if lie had been guardian, brother, or affianced lover, he could hardly have expressed it more decisively. Lola rallied him in her reply to this, and told him, what he ought to have remembered, that she had to be her own bread-winner, and that when her engagement with Uncle Manuel terminated, which it would very soon do, she should have to come to some decision for her own future ; she should be sorry to do anything he disapproved, but she had only one talent, and that she must use ; besides, they were in different spheres of life now, and he must cease to expect the same unity in their friend- sliip ; what cither did ought not longer to influence the other — ""for, indeed, I think, Cyrus, we are going two separate ways, and shall never meet any more as we did once,"" said she. It was a courage- ous little letter — not plaintive or melancholy or pathetic, but ver}^ quiet and sensible and reason- VOL.",alex,,
692,"I studied with assiduity the temper of Marguerite; I watched her looks; I endeavoured to anticipate her every wish. I meditated with care the plan of life which her simple and feeling heart, if solely consulted, would have led her originally to have chosen; and I copied out in the whole arrangement of our houshold the idea painted in my mind. Far from us were now the ostentation and pomp of the family chateau on the banks of the Garonne. We lived now, not to awaken admiration and envy in the bosom of guests and spectators; we lived for ourselves. Every thing was elegant; every thing was tasteful; but not an article found its place in our residence, that did not rest its claim to be there upon a plea of usefulness. Though, by the nature of my situation, I was superior to all restraint from a consideration of expence, yet our competent board and orderly habitation approached nearer in their appearance to the honest plainness of a rustic, than to the sumptuousness of hereditary nobility. A table set out with striking propriety and neatness, was preferred to the richness of plate and the splendour of porcelain and lustres.",alex,,
697,"Mother's was the right one as it appeared, for we had not walked many minutes, when we saw a white figure coming towards us, glimmering out of the dark, and heard a voice singing. “Ah, mon Dieu!” says mother, and “Gott sey dank,” and I know not what exclamations of gratitude and relief. It was the voice of the countess. As we came up, she knew us with our light, and began to imitate, in her crazy way, the cry of the watchman, whom the poor sleepless soul had often heard under her windows. “Past twelve o'clock, a starlight night!” she sang, and gave one of her sad laughs.",alex,,
702,"But his B 2 voice was very weak and treble. He had always been looking to benefit from change in the weather ; but the change came with- out the benefit. Now he wanted fine bracing weather — now good, summer suns ; now it was too wet, too sultry, too dry, too moist. He was hard to please ; and, in truth, the old man was not recovering, and was more failing, and fractious, and fatigued, and peevish, every day. "" What says Dr. Turner ?"" asks Jefirey, with interest, and with sympathy in his tones, for he perceived that an alteration had come ovei: the old man during the last few weeks. "" He's giving me some new medicine. I don't quite know what it is, but it's not un- pleasant.",alex,,
707,"I am sure of it. So if this alone has frightened the roses from your cheek, Theresa, summon them back as quickly as possible, for never was any apprehen- sion so entirely without foundation.

But he has also a heart o . which ' my little wife' is inscribed in lining letters, whose vitality will endm-e thi'ough- out all time. Be ccntent : you have your full share of love."" At tills moment the clock struck, and Theresa, smiling now through glad tears, sprang from her chair, and saying, "" It is time for me to carry Lawrence his glass of wine,'* ran lightly and with almost childish glee from the room. At length the Christmas guests began to arrive, and amongst the very first came Arthur Cressingham, — the Honourable Arthur Cressingham, — eldest son of a peer of the realm, heir to about fifteen thousand a year, and the handsomest man in England.",alex,,

722,"The good old man was astonished, and said all he could to persuade George to put off the mar- riage for a couple of years at least. All would not do, and he at last suc- ceeded in obtaining his consent; but in giving it he said he could not help say- ing a few words on the danger of such precipitance, and hoped they never might have cause to repent of it. ** You and my daughter,"" added he, "" are almost strangers to each other ; to your several tempers quite so — not that I would wish to take any merit from you, far less from my own child. — But the very circumstance of both of you being so quickly caught, shews an impetuosity of feeling dangerous to the possessors, as it tends to make them give way to appearances, whether fa- vourable or the reverse, and to judge without reflection. Notwithstanding this I trust you will be happy.",alex,,
727,"James responded in a con- ciliatory tone. "" But since we must converse on a painful matter, and as you do not entertain any friendly feeling to me, let us exercise self-control and forbear from irritating altercation. Of course I know what it is you wish to speak to me about. You need not trouble yourself to introduce the subject/'' "" But I will introduce the subject/' Hercules Kingsford responded fiercely. "" You may shrink from hearing all the misery that you have brought upon me and my wife : but I am no coward to shrink from recounting the humiliation with which your vindictive conspiracy has covered a man who was your friend, — yes, and Fll say it, if only that I may cancel the debt of gratitude you owe me and my family, — your benefactor.

732,"With your permission,"" concerning the seat he took, and that "" a draught of morn- ing air would do him good."" Then he laughed politely, exchanged wavy distant farewells with his comrades, touched a breast-pocket for his case of cigars, pulled forth one, obtained "" the loan of a light,'' blew clouds and fell into the anticipated composure^ quite understanding the case and his office. Both agreed as to the fine morning it was. Woodseer briefly assented to his keeper's reiterated encomium on the morning, justified on oath. A fine morning, indeed. '^ Damned if I think I ever saw so fine a morning ! "" Potts cried.",alex,,
737,"Though he had all along confidently looked forward to success, it quite took his breath away to find that every obstacle had vanished. The past had become an ugly dream, but it was difficult to escape from its influence in a moment. Gaunt gone and the Doctor released from his troubles — that was surely something to be thankful for. And now Nellie was really to be his ! The castles they had built together rose before his dazzled eyes, and his cheeks glowed as he gazed upon them. Suddenly he sprang up and went across to Sterne. '' I owe my happiness to yon,"" he said. ^'",alex,,

She would be happy, quite happy, if she saw us all here together, and if she knew ' 'Plantagenet,' said Lady Annabel, 'you must build a lodge at this end of tho park. I cannot conceive anythino more effective than an entrance from the Southport road in this quarter.' ' Certainly, Lady Annabel, certainly wc must build a lodge. Do not you think so, Venetia ?",alex,,
747,"These fragrant beauties are the chief rewards the considerate pro- phet bestows on his obedient worshippers, to whom he has bequeathed this most con- soling volume. Month after month hostilities continued, without any apparent prospect of an ap- proach to a conclusion. Eeports were rife, that some mortars were coming from some quarter for the use of the besiegers, but no such effective pieces of ordnance ever ap- peared, and we grew weary of the con- tinuance of what at first had greatly excited us. Though forbidden to manifest any open preference for their favourites, "" the outside party,"" the mids could not always resist the temptation held out to them to enter the forts, and fire a shot or two at any conspicuous object on the walls of the town, especially if it looked like a French ofiicer from the corvette in the harbour, which certainly favoured the be- sieged. Upon one occasion, a gang of us were thus employed as amateur artillerists, when a succession of well-directed shot from the foe admonished us of our imprudence, and nearly smothered us with the sand thrown up around. Having a strong opinion of the force and efficacy of example, we did not immediately decamp, but dis- charged every gun at our command with some effect, much to the delight of the applauding Arabs, who waved their bur- nooses, and shouted forth defiance. After this we departed, not quite sure of being overburdened with sense.",alex,,
