251,"It was amazing to me, that his sensations, so contradictory to the absurd crotchet he had taken into his head, did not convince him of his error, especially when so frequently com- pelled to act in obedience to long accustomed impulses. As, for instance, on my rising to go, he suddenly started from his chair, shook my hands, and accompanied me to the door, as if nothing had been the matter. "" Well now ! What do you think of that ? "" said I, triumphantly. "" Ah, ah !"" said he, after a puzzled pause, "" but you little know the effort it cost me ! "" * # * * He did not persevere long in the absurd way of putting on his clothes which I have just described ; but, even after he had discontinued it, he alleged his opinion to be, that the front of his clothes ought to be with his face ! I might relate many similar fooleries springing from this notion of his turned head, but sufficient has been said already to give the reader a clear idea of the general character of such delusions. My subsequent inter- views with him, while under this unprecedented hallucination, were similar to the two which I have attempted to describe.",mark,,
252,"Definitively then, you will not allow me to write to the minister?"" *^ If I permitted all my prisoners to write to his Excellency, his whole time would be lost in reading petitions, and / should deserve to lose my place. I have heard enough. '' "" One word more, Captain ! If the words of a honest man possess any value in your eyes, I swear to you that the honour, life, and for- tune, of the Count von Spulgen, as well as the repose of another whom I will not now name, are at this moment in the greatest danger ! If, this day, the minister do not get my letter, to- morrow he is lost!""",alex,,
253,"to be mixed up with such a very old- fashioned figure, at the very moment of first showing ourselves ! Will it not be running into danger ? "" "" It is no good to talk about it, Maria,"" he re- plied, with an impatient action of both reins and whip. "" You may depend upon it that there are many fashionable young people, besides ourselves, who have quizzical governors. It is one of the things one must bear, you know, like the toothache, or anything else that can't be helped. It's no good to grumble.",jessica,,
254,"I say, he's — he's — very quiet, isn't he ? "" asked the breathless equestrian, as the horse sidled away amongst his old friends the hounds, snorting, shaking his head, and "" reaching "" at his bridle, in a manner which much discomposed the security of his rider's seat. "" These large horses require a deal of holding,"" added he, half ashamed of his want of skill in the manege^ as, with mounting colour, he knotted his reins and crammed his hat down upon his head in a '' do-or-die "" sort of fashion which was anything but suggestive of a pleasant .excursion ; but the Doctor was now in for it, and being a gallant little fellow at heart, there was a game sparkle in his eye that, with all his misgivings as to the result, showed he ""meant mischief."" My attention, however, was soon taken up with the many and onerous duties of my posi- tion ; and, after mucli consultation with the sporting agriculturists who constituted my field, we hastened to dispose ourselves over the surrounding country, and spread abroad in every dKcction, peeping into furrows and lash- ing turnip-tops, in the orthodox manner of performing that not very enlivening ceremony denominated *' drawing for a hare."" The farmers were a capital set of fellows, thorough sportsmen one and all ; the country, a ^^dld district, with few resident landlords, and totally unpreserved. Com^sing was a favourite amusement with the aboriginal in- habitants ; and I have no doubt that whenever a poor man wanted a brace of partridges or a pheasant, he went to look for them without more ado. All this might be very pleasant, but, as may be supposed, was not conducive to the superabundance of game.",svenja,,
255,"Will not the reader tire, if I should minutely describe our long-drawn journey from Paris to Geneva? If, day by day, I should record, in the form of a journal, the thronging miseries of our lot, could my hand write, or language afford words to express, the variety of our woe; the hustling and crowding of one deplorable event upon another? Patience, oh reader! whoever thou art, wherever thou dwellest, whether of race spiritual, or, sprung from some surviving pair, thy nature will be human, thy habitation the earth; thou wilt here read of the acts of the extinct race, and wilt ask wonderingly, if they, who suffered what thou findest recorded, were of frail flesh and soft organization like thyself. Most true, they were—weep therefore; for surely, solitary being, thou wilt be of gentle disposition; shed compassionate tears; but the while lend thy attention to the tale, and learn the deeds and sufferings of thy predecessors. Yet the last events that marked our progress through France were so full of strange horror and gloomy misery, that I dare not pause too long in the narration. If I were to dissect each incident, every small fragment of a second would contain an harrowing tale, whose minutest word would curdle the blood in thy young veins.",matt,,
256,"The shore was bold and winding ; his steps sometimes circled round a jutting point, and the next moment descended into a grassy glen, while the stream ran calm and silently by. Seating himself on a moss covered rock, close to the water's edge, he watched the rays of the sun slowly steal over the scene. Hearing the soft sound of approaching steps, he turned, and saw Catherine Dawnay ad vane- ing along the shore. The calmness and fresh- ness of the morning had led her to choose this path, and she walked on slowly, unconscious of the presence of a being in the place. Her eyes were bent thoughtfully on the ground, and the rich colour that always wantoned in her cheek was heightened by the pure breeze; her air and step were those of a proud woman, yet of one whose pride at this moment was combated by a more master passion. ""Is it you P' 1 she said hurriedly, as her look was turned for a moment on his moveless figure. "" I had not thought to find a human being in this lonely path ; but midnight and sun-rise are your wandering hours.",mark,,
257,"This reason cannot yet be mentioned— he had hardly revealed it to himself—it was deep down in his soul—to be or not to be—as circumstances, time, and the hour should decide. After having lived so long in retirement, our young hero, when he was to go into company again, had many fears, that his manners would appear rustic and unfashioned. With all these apprehensions as to his manners, there was mixed a large proportion of pride of character, which tended rather to encrease than to diminish his apparent timidity. He dreaded that people should value him, or think that he valued himself, for his newly acquired fortune, instead of his good qualities—he feared that he should be flattered—and he feared that he should like flattery. —In the midst of all these various and contradictory apprehensions, he would perhaps have been awkward and miserable, had he been introduced into society by one who had less knowledge of the world, or less knowledge of the human, heart than Sir Ulick O'Shane possessed. Sir Ulick treated him as if he had always lived in good company. Without presupposing any ignorance or any difficulty, he at the same time always took care to warn him of any etiquette, or of any modern fashion, so that no one should perceive the warning but themselves.—",alex,,

At last he spoke. Perhaps it was relief to him to speak. To Bloemfontein in the Free State, to which through an agent he had traced them, Gregory had gone.

265,"He went forward the more carelessly, I must suppose; for presently we saw him sink a little down, draw up his feet and sink again, and so twice. Then he turned his face to us, pretty white. “Lend a hand,” said he, “I am in a bad place.” “I don't know about that,” says Ballantrae, standing still. Dutton broke out into the most violent oaths, sinking a little lower as he did, so that the mud was nearly to his waist, and plucking a pistol from his belt, “Help me,” he cries, “or die and be damned to you!” “Nay,” says Ballantrae, “I did but jest. I am coming.”",matt,,

Without intending, or even being himself quite conscious of the fact, George's letters to Lis sister had altered a good deal both in style and sentiment, in consequence of the feelings he had taken back to town with him at Christmas.

269,"Even in the old Palazzo, a guest of this description had been occasionally received, and had sat discussing some point of antiquarian lore, or something about tlie old books at Colla, with her father without taking any notice, beyond what civility demanded, of the little girl who sat at the head of the table. She did not doubt it would be the same thing to-night ; and though Markham was always 7iice, never leaving her out, never letting the conversation drop altogether into that stream of personality or allusion which makes Society so intolerable to a stranger, she yet prepared for the evening with the feeling that dulness awaited her, and not pleasure. One of the guests, however, was of a kind which Frances did not expect. He was young, very young in appearance, rather small and delicate, but at the same time re- fined, with a look of gentle melancholy upon a countenance which was almost beautiful, with child-like limpid eyes, and features of extreme delicacy and purity. This was something quite unlike the elderly antiquarians who talked so glibly to her father about Eoman remains or Etruscan art. He sat between Lady Markham and herself, and spoke in gentle tones, with a soft affectionate manner, to her mother, who replied with the kindness and easy afFectionate- ness which were habitual to her. To see the sweet looks which this young gentleman re- ceived, and to hear the tender questions about his health and his occupations which Lady Markham put to him, awoke in the mind of Frances another doubt of the same character as those others from which she had not been able to get free.",svenja,,

Mr. Robinson would have looked foolish, but that his consternation was too great to admit of the manifestation of any minor emotion. He arose, and walked to the door of the office, which he opened stealthily, and having satisfied him- self that neither Jeffries nor his companion, Hunsman, were listening, a frailty to which the former, as Robinson well knew, was especially prone, he silently returned to his seat. *' Well, Mr. Robinson."" said Bouverie, after a long pause, taking out his watch ; '* my time is precious.

She stretches up her small hands now and begins to play with the great bunch of seals and trinkets attached to Hubert's Avatch-chain.

273,"Before the fever broke out, they were often thrown ^' ^ together. together, and she heard, as it was intended she should hear, that their names were very often mingled. Florence Seton, if she could not hear this without a blush — for she was not wholly sorry to hear it — had no cause to blush, for any share that she had had in giving foundation to what was said. She had gone to the work that St. Hilda's offered, without any thought of what might come of it as regarded Crispin ; but she felt that his society did not certainly pre- vent her going on; and then she heard what she had hardly liked to put to herself, his name w4th hers. They sounded very well together. Florence Seton kept to herself her own thoughts; and her manner towards Crispin, was just w hat that of a woman so circumstanced should always be.",jessica,,
274,"The road to Earlshall led through plantations that belonged to the Earl: the sound came in that direction, and I hoped it might be some one coming in search of us. As the sound came nearer and nearer, I was almost sure I could distinguish Ginger's step; a little nearer still, and I could tell she was in the dog-cart. I neighed loudly, and was overjoyed to hear an answering neigh from Ginger, and men's voices. They came slowly over the stones, and stopped at the dark figure that lay upon the ground. One of the men jumped out, and stooped down over it. “It is Reuben!” he said, “and he does not stir.”",svenja,,
275,"It is necessary to say a word or two about Mrs. Norris. She had been a singer of some eminence ; and between her professional talents and, we may add, ses beaux yeux, very discreetly applied, had realized an income sufficient for her wants and those of her daughter, and which permitted her to indulge in some few luxuries besides, exclu- sively of the little suppers — to one of which we are about to introduce the gentle reader. Mrs. Norris was quite a person of good cha- racter, not such, perhpas, as would be personified in the beau ideal of Mrs. Chapone, or of Mrs. Hannah More, but still, as has been said, she had made use of ses beaux yeux with such un- common discretion, that the most censorious persons could find nothing worse to say of her than that, during ten years of her life passed in Italy for the improvement of her singing and for her health, she was very much admired, very gay, and delightfully amiable. Some, indeed, thought she was more particularly appreciated by a noble- man of large fortune, devoted to the fine arts; but nothing certain was ever known on this score. The said nobleman married precisely at the same period that Mrs. Norris's husband returned from America, where he had been acting Othello and King John, George Barnwell and Scrub. Mr. Norris, however, was a wretch of whom we will not speak, for all agreed that he behaved scandalously to his wife, and, in fact, he was said to have abandoned her.

276,"Such was his mood of mind when the stable-clock struck ten — the hour when the post was due : and before long a tray of letters was brought to him. He had only expected one which could bear on his anxiety. Instead of one there were three. There was the one he expected ; he knew it must be her handAvriting ; he looked at the back, and there he saw her monogram. Besides that there was one from her eldest sister, and there was another from Mrs. Harley. He read the one from the eldest sister first. She accepted Carew's explanation with regard to the presence of Foreman, but slie did so in phrases of such studied coldness as to show that her displeasure remained, although the alleged pretext for it had been abandoned.",mark,,
277,"The children appeared almost distracted; their grief had more of that stunning character which attends unexpected calamity, than of sorrow for one who is gradually drawn from life. At length the messenger entered the room, and almost choked with tears, stated that both priests were absent that day at Conference, and would not return till late. The hitherto moderated grief of the wife arose to a pitch much wilder than the death of her husband could, under ordinary circumstances, occasion. To die without absolution--to pass away into eternity ""unanointed, unaneled""--without being purified from the inherent stains of humanity--was to her a much deeper affliction than her final separation from him. She cried in tones of the most piercing despair, and clapped her hands, as they do who weep over the dead. Had he died in the calm confidence of having received the Viaticum, or Sacrament before death, his decease would have had nothing remarkably calamitous in it, beyond usual occurrences of a similar nature. Now the grief was intensely bitter in consequence of his expected departure without the priest.",alex,,

285,"Having effected the reunion of Raymond and Perdita, I was eager to return to England; but his earnest request, added to awakening curiosity, and an indefinable anxiety to behold the catastrophe, now apparently at hand, in the long drawn history of Grecian and Turkish warfare, induced me to consent to prolong until the autumn, the period of my residence in Greece. As soon as the health of Raymond was sufficiently re-established, he prepared to join the Grecian camp, near Kishan, a town of some importance, situated to the east of the Hebrus; in which Perdita and Clara were to remain until the event of the expected battle. We quitted Athens on the 2nd of June. Raymond had recovered from the gaunt and pallid looks of fever. If I no longer saw the fresh glow of youth on his matured countenance, if care had besieged his brow, if his hair, slightly mingled with grey, and his look, considerate even in its eagerness, gave signs of added years and past sufferings, yet there was something irresistibly affecting in the sight of one, lately snatched from the grave, renewing his career, untamed by sickness or disaster. The Athenians saw in him, not as heretofore, the heroic boy or desperate man, who was ready to die for them; but the prudent commander, who for their sakes was careful of his life, and could make his own warrior-propensities second to the scheme of conduct policy might point out. All Athens accompanied us for several miles.",matt,,

288,"Of her few faults, perhaps the great- est is that she seldom knows her own mind, where her lovers are concerned, and will blow hot and cold, and merry and sad, and cheerful and petulant, all in one breath as it were. Poor lovers ! they have a hard time of it with her as a rule. But youth is often so, and the cold still years, as they creep on us, with dull common sense and deadly reason in their train, cure us all too soon of our pretty idle follies. Just now she was bent on rebuffing him, but you see her strength failed her, and she spoiled her effect by the smile she mingled with the rebuff'. The smile indeed was so charming, that he remembers nothing but it, and so she not only gains nothing, but loses somethmg to the other side.

All that could be done to clear her sister's fame from so foul a charge had been achieved; but Felicia had learnt to approximate the most distant periods, and familiarize her mind to what might be the consequence of present events. She felt that the purity of a name once defiled, like a gathered floweret, fades away ; and its fresh- ness, its lustre, never return. Silent and de- jected, she reached the place where she had de- sired the coachman would wait their return, and without speaking, threw herself into the carriage.

It was not likely Isis and her mother could ever be informed of any transactions within the Inquisition, and of course the treachery of Leolfo could not be suspected. His errand was, to feast his eyes once more with the deli, cate charms of Isis, before he fixed his determination.

Charles, in the mean time, slowly reco- vered his strength, and the rose of health • faintly tinged his cheek; when lady Sedge- wood pointed this out to me as a comfort* my jaundiced mind instantly converted it into a source of sorrow; and I applied Mrs. Opie's lines to the case-^- u For health I saw in Henry's bloom, Nor knew it mark'd him for the tomb ;"" and from this time every indication he gave of health, I attributed to sickness; and by a parity of reasoning, I concluded that Adelaide was undoubtedly affected precise- ly in the same way; and that if ever her wanderings ceased> and I was permitted once more to cast my eyes on her lovely form, it would be merely to witness the same terrible beauty which lighted up the sunken eye, and painted the cheeks of those lovely victims which had so often M 2 awakened my compassion at the Hot-wells of Bristol. Under these reflections, my days were consumed with regret, my nights a prey to anguish ; and I glided round my paternal domains, rather like the ghost of some for- mer possessor revisiting them, than the ac- tual incumbent, called upon to fulfil im- portant duties, and occupy the place of the baronet.",svenja,,

General Tracy was not at Northferry. Mr. Tracy had, with a cowardice not altogether singular, concealed from his brother the com- pact between Sir William and himself, till the old officer was in London ; and had then written to tell him that Emily was engaged to the young baronet, and to be married immediately.

But the change of my name, the abruptness with which I removed from place to place, the remoteness and the obscurity which I proposed to myself in the choice of my abode, were all insufficient to elude the sagacity of Jones, or the unrelenting constancy with which Mr. Falkland incited my tormentor to pursue me.

Presently she plainly distinguished the clash of arms, and the shrill accents of old Bridget and her attendant damsel, partly in terror and partly in supplication ; but while all this reached her from below, and her anxiety to hear plainly the subject of dispute became more intense, and caused her to hold her breath, lest her respiration should prevent her facility of listening, the harsh, angry voices sank to faint whispers on her ear, and she fell back upon her pillow in a state of utter insensibility.",alex,,
348,"""But, as you have a curiosity concerning some of these things, I may take the opportunity of adding, that so largely is our English language embued with the French, and especially with the Norman French of the era of the Con- quest; that, as I have been assured by a Norman Frenchman of scholastic turn, if an ordinary Englishman were to pass through the country parts of Normandy, so as to compare the ancient Norman witli the modern English, he could scarcely fail to understand every word that he should hear. And (as, indeed, it ought to have been expected,) it might seem, that the modern or Parisian French, has receded from the Norman dialect, while the modern or English has pre- served it ! He gave me, as an exam])le, the country-Norman pouquette, which is the Eng- lish pocket. The modern French, in the mean time, is poche^ for which the Norman must be jjouque ; and it is from these two words that we receive poke and pouch. As to the ancient diffusion of Norman French over every thing English, except that which even under the Con- quest retained its rusticity, and what is a further proof, that our Latin derivatives have usually come to us through the French, it may be ob- served; not only that the Jlesh of almost all the animals we eat, changes names from the Bri- tish and Anglo-Saxon to the Norman French, as it passes from the fields and farms to the town and table ; but that our very words meat and hutcher are French, and have taken the places of ^r.s7i Rudjlesher, which latter, however, are still used in the northern parts of our island.

I am very sorry we do not live nearer to each other, as it would give me great pleasure to conduct you over my establishment, and to receive from you any hints as to its arrangements which you might be able to give. You should clearly understand that it is not what is usually termed a lunatic asylum. I receive only twelve ladies or gentlemen whose cases are of the lightest description ; so much so, in fact, that no one who has not gone so deeply as yourself into the subject could detect that there was anything abnormal about them. I do not even call them my patients, I consider them solely as my guests, and treat them as such ; and I assure you a happier little community than we form it would be difficult to meet with.""

458,"There is a certain class of persons — narrow in mind, affectionate in temperament, and pene- trated with vanity — to whom generosity is easy but obligation impossible. When the question is of spontaneous assistance to a superior, there are no bounds to the good they will do, so long as they can peacock themselves with the thought that they have ministered to the god and fed the king's son. But let that god lose his divinity and show himself shorn of his rays — let that king's son be cast down from his throne and thrust into the mud — let divinity and royalty be brought to the base level of the once proud protector, then claim continuance of that former protection — and the scene changes. It is no longer a matter for vanity, for self-gratulation, for self-peacocking. It is not protecting the superior ; it is simply helping the equal — maybe the inferior. The gifts which were tribute become now the doles which are charities, and by this change of character lose their charm. Duty is not so pleasant as free- dom ; and the king's son in rags is not like the king's son in ermine and purple.",jessica,,

Nor can it yet be forgotten that a law-suit was instituted against him on the matter of that charity by Mr. John Bold, who afterwards married his, Mr. Harding's, younger and then only unmarried daughter. Under pressure of these attacks, Mr. Harding had resigned his wardenship, though strongly recommended to abstain from doing so, both by his friends and by his lawyers. He did, however, resign it, and betook himself manfully to the duties of the small parish of St. Cuthbert's, in the city, of which he was vicar, continuing also to perform those of precentor of the cathedral, a situation of small emolument which had hitherto been supposed to be joined, as a matter of course, to the wardenship of the Hospital above spoken of. When he left the hospital from which he had been so ruthlessly driven, and settled himself down in his own modest manner in the High Street of Barchester, he had not expected that others would make more fuss about it than he was inclined to do himself; and the extent of his hope was, that the movement might have been made in time to prevent any further paragraphs in the Jupiter. His affairs, however, were not allowed to subside thus quietly, and people were quite as much inclined to talk about the disinterested sacrifice he had made, as they had before been to upbraid him for his cupidity.

In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt's Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in.

Then calling aloud to the dismayed forces of his late enemy, he invited them under his banner, engaging to rule them with equity and moderation; at the same time, declaring to them that he was their rightful sovereign. The troops, David thought, came crowding round him, and did him ho- mage as their lord ; when mounting again upon Slouch, they all marched off B3 together towards Stirling, nigh nnto which place the action had happened. David was now in the height of extasy, not doubting but the people who had so joyfully received his master, would as readily, at his command, conduct him to his principality ; and was just forming his method of behaviour, and the manner in which he should be received by his subjects,- when the acclamations of the troops awakened him, at broad day-light, lonely and deserted, without friend or companion, in a thin part of the wood, where he could cast his eves around him for some distance, between the trees. David was at first dubious, whether the scenes he had before been engaged in were realities, and himself then in a dream when he supposed them vanish- ed -, or whether he had been dreaming before, and was now awake; till rising •k *■»*%/%»■»%-* ■W%/V'»""V from his seat, and performing several of the functions of a wakeful animal, he be- came much dissatisfied, that all the pleasurable prospects before presented to him had been a dream, and that himself and master were rejected Princes still; but the metal he was formed of, and the strength of his ruling passion, ena- bling him to discharge all despondency, he set forward with perseverance, for the recovery of his lost master, patron, and friend.

This was the question which he tried to answer, but which perplexed him the more deeply he pondered upon it. One thing was clear — he must see his wife, and endeavour, by menaces or promises, to turn her from her expressed purpose. How he could contrive to effect this without arous- ing Mrs. Emmerson's suspicions was more than he could decide upon at that moment ; but, in any case, it must be done, he decided. Chance favoured him, however, for in two or three days afterwards — days which were spent by him in a state of great doubt and alarm — a letter came from Edmund Mon- tressor, dated from the same place in Lon- don, stating that he had been robbed of all his money whilst travelling on the Conti- nent, and asking for another two hundred pounds, to enable him to tide over his affairs until the end of the year.",matt,,

At this juncture she received a letter from For- tescue, urging her to come down to them, if it were only for a few days, as he thought Julia grew worse and worse ; colder and colder to him she certainly did.

We were sitting on the engine it- self, whose blazing fire kept us at a most com- fortable temperature, although all without was a glorious scene of ice and snow ; every tree was frosted, and nothing to be seen for leagues and leagues but that solemn snow-covered land- scape ; relieved by the dark pine-trees and forests of evergreen on the tops of some of the high mountains. Now and then we would come upon a long train — a line of cars they would call it here — humbly drawn up on one side of the road to allow our three little spinning engines to fly past unmolested ; for the telegraph was kept at work incessantly during the two days of our most original excursion, to give warning of our approach, and convey the order from the Directors, who were of our party, to suspend all traffic on the line until we had rushed past. Suddenly would occur a deep bend on the line and a curve which would cause the first engine, our leader, to pass in a parallel line with us, as if retracing its steps many yards below us — that was a pretty sight, as we rushed wildly after each other through this ghostly-looking universe of snow !

A foreigner on board the packet, compared the view to that which the bay of Naples presents: I cannot judge of the justness of the comparison, though I am told one very general and common-place; but if the scenic beauties of the Irish bay are exceeded by those of the Neapolitan, my fancy falls short in a just conception of its charms. The springing-up of a contrary wind kept us for a considerable time beating about this enchanting coast: the weather suddenly changed, the rain poured in torrents, a storm arose, and the beautiful prospect, which had fascinated our gaze, vanished in mists of impenetrable obscurity. As we had the mail on board, a boat was sent out to receive it, the oars of which were plied by six men, whose statures, limbs, and features, declared them the lingering progeny of the once formidable race of Irish giants. Bareheaded, they “bided the pelting of the pitiless storm,” with no other barrier to its fury than what tattered check trowsers, and shirts open at the neck, tucked above the elbows, afforded; and which, thus disposed, betrayed the sinewy contexture of forms, which might have individually afforded a model to sculpture, for the colossal statue of a Hercules, under all the different aspects of strength and exertion.This little marine sketch is by no means a fancy picture; it was actually copied from the life, in the summer of 1805. A few of the passengers proposing to venture in the boat, I listlessly followed, and found myself seated by one of these sea-monsters, who, in an accent and voice that made me startle, addressed me in English at least as pure and correct as a Thames boatman would use; and with so much courtesy, cheerfulness, and respect, that I was at a loss how to reconcile the civilization of his manner to such a ferocity of appearance; while his companions, as they stemmed the mountainous waves, or plied their heavy oars, displayed such a vein of low humour and quaint drollery, and in a language so curiously expressive and original, that no longer able to suppress my surprize, I betrayed it to a gentleman who sat near me; he assured me that this species of colloquial wit was peculiar to the lower classes of the Irish, who borrowed much of their curious phraseology from the peculiar idiom of their own tongue, and the cheeriness of manner from the native exility of their temperament; “and, as for their courteousness,” he continued, “you will find them on a further intercourse, obsequious even to adulation, as long as you treat them with apparent kindness; but an opposite conduct will prove their manner proportionably uncivilized.”",mark,,

But look at that sketch: it is a fancy of Piero di Cosimo's, a strange freakish painter, who says he saw it by long looking at a mouldy wall.” The sketch Nello pointed to represented three masks—one a drunken laughing Satyr, another a sorrowing Magdalen, and the third, which lay between them, the rigid, cold face of a Stoic: the masks rested obliquely on the lap of a little child, whose cherub features rose above them with something of the supernal promise in the gaze which painters had by that time learned to give to the Divine Infant. “A symbolical picture, I see,” said the young Greek, touching the lute while he spoke, so as to bring out a slight musical murmur. “The child, perhaps, is the Golden Age, wanting neither worship nor philosophy. And the Golden Age can always come back as long as men are born in the form of babies, and don't come into the world in cassock or furred mantle.",svenja,,

With his mind deeply depressed, the Captain returned oo board; long had had he experienced unhappiness, but the events of the last week had struck the shaft still deeper in his heart; nor could the friendship of Mr. Talton, or the affection of Frederick, preserve him from a corroding melancholy. The death of Sir Henry, as St. Ledger, was universally regretted ; even the obdurate Harland, for a moment, forgot his enmity, and expressed a senti- ment of pity; whilst the generous Fre- derick, who had regarded him with fra- ternal friendship, paid that tribute to his memory his merits demanded ; and whilst he dwelt with praises on the name of his friend, the faltering accent and half-suppressed sigh evinced the sin- cerity of his grief for his loss. Mr, Mr. Talton finding the impracticability of his endeavours to alleviate the sor- row of the Captain, took his leave, and set out for London, to acquaint Lady Corbet with the death of her son : as, however disagreeable the task, he rather chose to inform her himself, than hazard an abrupt disclosure from an uninte- rested person, or even by epistolary communication. The Captain felt relieved at his de- parture, as he wished to visit the grave of Sir Henry, but was unwilling to be- tray the weakness of his heart, even to his friend. The ensuing morning, therefore, he went on shore, and, unat- tended, pursued his way to the church- yard; where a simple flag of fragrant turf turf marked the spot where the remains of the unfortmiate youth were laid.

Her conscience perpetually instigated to lier, that to deprive a fellow- creature of life in the fuiy of vengeance, or the rashness of passion, was dreadful; nor could the plea so often advanced, that the life cf the successful combatant had been equally exposed, extenuate in her heart the horror of the homicide — since homicide it is called.

Moreover, a great danseuse must be possessed of a very mobik' face ; for in a form of art in which words are interdicted all emotions have to be expressed by the movements of the face and the body, and they must be so marked that the public may grasp the situation at a glance. Pantomime is one of the most im])ortant parts of a ballet-girl's education ; dei)ort- ment is almost as essential. But the girl who aspires to become a really great danseuse must not only be consummate in all the technique of the art, but she must also be born with the instincts of a tragic actress, for to stir the emotions of the s])ectators, as Taglioni is said to have done, when you are unable to open your mouth, requires as much genius as to act the parts of Oi)holia or Lady Macbeth.

My soldiers, who have approached close up to their lines undiscovered, or, if observed, unat- tended to by them, report, that they are now solely occupied with feasting, carous- ing, and rural sports. There is not a man amongst them, that has got on his armour, but they are all like holiday folk in the midst of a peaceful and friendly country. If we wish to destroy them utterly, every practised soldier in this camp will tell your Majesty that this is a moment for making an attack upon them. Give them not an instant to prepare for battle, and you force them to fight with such disadvantage, that their defeat is certain, or, if they have time to retreat in safety to their camp, their entrenchments can be no protection to those who have once been seized with a panic fear.""",svenja,,

"" They were all prowling about the gar- den, and there are hedges and things ! I had much sooner trust to stone walls tlian to those walks. IIow can one tell who's listening ? "" "" Dear me !

"" She spoke very lightly, for she had no wish for Grey's confidences now — and it did not seem as if she were likely to get any.",matt,,
746,"To find that he had cared for her in earnest was a complete surprise to her. She was a girl who was remarkably free from the common female attribute of vanity, and was not at all likely to imagine any admiration of herself as existing, un- less it were expressed very plainly indeed. He had never told her right out that he cared for her, nor had he in any other way made ^his sentiments evident enough for her to perceive them. Since the time of her coming out, her life had been amply filled by the business entailed upon her by this new phase of ex- istence — the business of assimilating some things to herself and herself to others, by which process her character was being un- consciously transmuted and formed whilst still retaining its own original individu- ality as the foundation. In all that ap- pertained to this, she had been too fully occupied to have time to trouble her head with speculations as to whether any par- ticular person liked her or not, or to what extent the liking might go. She had always supposed that Mr Sylvester must think her tolerably agreeable because he seemed to like to be with her ; but she attached no further importance than that to his fondness for her society. She had generally found him pleasant, and had learnt to recognise that he possessed a strange power of attraction that was pecu- liar to himself",mark,,
747,"These fragrant beauties are the chief rewards the considerate pro- phet bestows on his obedient worshippers, to whom he has bequeathed this most con- soling volume. Month after month hostilities continued, without any apparent prospect of an ap- proach to a conclusion. Eeports were rife, that some mortars were coming from some quarter for the use of the besiegers, but no such effective pieces of ordnance ever ap- peared, and we grew weary of the con- tinuance of what at first had greatly excited us. Though forbidden to manifest any open preference for their favourites, "" the outside party,"" the mids could not always resist the temptation held out to them to enter the forts, and fire a shot or two at any conspicuous object on the walls of the town, especially if it looked like a French ofiicer from the corvette in the harbour, which certainly favoured the be- sieged. Upon one occasion, a gang of us were thus employed as amateur artillerists, when a succession of well-directed shot from the foe admonished us of our imprudence, and nearly smothered us with the sand thrown up around. Having a strong opinion of the force and efficacy of example, we did not immediately decamp, but dis- charged every gun at our command with some effect, much to the delight of the applauding Arabs, who waved their bur- nooses, and shouted forth defiance. After this we departed, not quite sure of being overburdened with sense.",alex,,
748,"The dress of the chief was perfectly national. His trews and plaid were the tartan of his clan, and his bonnet was distinguished by a single plume of an erne. His attendants were dressed in the philabeg and plaid. The chief took St. Cldye by the arm, and the whole party went to Dunmorven castle. Dunmorven himself enquired parti- cularly how his son had fallen in bat- tle; and when they came to the castle, Lady Dunmorven and her daughters, to whom St, Clyde was introduced by the chief, welcomed their visitor as be* came their dignity and his rank. But no sooner had this ceremony ceased, than the dutiful and parental soul of the mother and her daughters turned on the fate of the lamented Vich Ean Dunmorven. It was clear to St. Clyde that this mother had not yet ceased to brood over the fate of her son, and the death of their brother had given the young ladies a large share of the wild abs- tracted mourner; indulging in an in- tensity of feelings ; stung with disap- pointed hopes ; maddening with indig- nation at the fury of murderous bat- tle ; and drooping with hopeless recol- lections of the days of childhood and youth which the lamented Vich Ean Dunmorven had passed under his sire's paternal roof.",jessica,,
749,"So far as I can see, so far as I can learn from what seems to be the universal opinion here, the Presidential election of this Autumn is to be fought out, not indeed on the direct issue of slavery or eman- cipation throughout the States, but on a question of sectional hostility between North and South, of which, whether the North mean it or not, this must be the outcome. I can read in your face, Florence, that still your sympathies go with your section ; you feel still as a Louisianian, and you will not blame me if it should be my fate to fight for the laws that have done you such bitter wrong. Well ; but this is the point, this is the way in which this excitement bears on you? On the subject of slavery and everything touching the slave code, the feeling here and throughout the Gulf States is so passionate, so sensitive, that it is dan- gerous to touch it ; and there is no more chance of carrying a measure of justice, even to an individual victim of that code, at this moment, than there would be of passing a grant to Eoman Catholic schools in England in the midst of a furious No-Popery agitation. 80 I find that in postponing all other steps, all en- deavours to emancipate you and your sisters by my own act, and relying on Colonel's Marion's plan, I have made it impossible to restore your legal freedom, at least for months to come. I know I am to blame ; but don't think too hardly of me. It was not that I would have consciously, willingly have neglected any- thing I knew to be necessary towards your freedom ; but, knowing you safe after my death, I was not so^ eager to j)artwith you as I ought to have been.""",svenja,,

The Duchesse de Noailles, Mademoiselle d'Aumale and myself were always disputing as to the rank we held in her affection, and Her Royal Highness the Duchesse de Bour- gogne would playfully join in those contesta- tions. How well I remember the childish, winning grace with which she exclaimed, one day when my aunt would not employ her as she did us, to write letters for her, "" Is not Adelaide de Savoie good gentle- woman enough to serve you?""'
