253,"to be mixed up with such a very old- fashioned figure, at the very moment of first showing ourselves ! Will it not be running into danger ? "" "" It is no good to talk about it, Maria,"" he re- plied, with an impatient action of both reins and whip. "" You may depend upon it that there are many fashionable young people, besides ourselves, who have quizzical governors. It is one of the things one must bear, you know, like the toothache, or anything else that can't be helped. It's no good to grumble.",jessica,,

263,"She hurried after him, and called him by his name. * Bill.' Bill turned round sharply ; it was an unusual thing for any one to accost him in the street ; but when he saw that it was Bachel, he was astounded. ' ""Well, I'm curst if it ain't Bachel. I'll be bound ! ' And by way of expressing his amazement^ he stuck his hands deep in his breeches pockets, and fetched his shoulders up about his ears. ' How is father.",jessica,,
268,"Granby was about to express his doubts with considerable warmth, but prudence checked his tongue. Trebeck carelessly proceeded. "" Ay, there she did not judge amiss. Chesterton was worth encouragement. Old Banbury, the father, has thirty thousand a year at least. Mamma had probably drilled her a llittlande and I don't know whether she might not have caught hirn, if she had gone on as prudently as she began ; but she is not sufficiently practised yet."" ""Do you think then,"" said Granby, with suppressed emotion, "" that she is likely to be- come one of your mere establishment-seekers ?"" """,jessica,,
273,"Before the fever broke out, they were often thrown ^' ^ together. together, and she heard, as it was intended she should hear, that their names were very often mingled. Florence Seton, if she could not hear this without a blush — for she was not wholly sorry to hear it — had no cause to blush, for any share that she had had in giving foundation to what was said. She had gone to the work that St. Hilda's offered, without any thought of what might come of it as regarded Crispin ; but she felt that his society did not certainly pre- vent her going on; and then she heard what she had hardly liked to put to herself, his name w4th hers. They sounded very well together. Florence Seton kept to herself her own thoughts; and her manner towards Crispin, was just w hat that of a woman so circumstanced should always be.",jessica,,

283,"What I particularly wish to impress upon you is the expediency of confining the future educa- tion of Miss Ella Ashton to the simply useful. It will be most ill-advised to persist in a course of accomplishments totally incompatible with her probable after-position ; and, indeed, all possible competition with her cousins must be carefully avoided. The sooner she is taught to understand the difference in their prospects, the more easily she will become reconciled to what cannot be repaired."" "" It is a sad pity !"" sighed madame, half sorrowfully, and half indignantly ; "" for she is full of talent and enthusiasm."" ""I am sorry to hear it;"" was the hard reply ; "" as neither the one nor the other is Ukely to profit her in the world. Be that as it may, however, you now know my sentiments and feeKngs upon the subject, and you will much oblige me by acting accordingly."" "" It will be a terrible blow to the poor dear child ;"" said the Frenchwoman. """,jessica,,
288,"Of her few faults, perhaps the great- est is that she seldom knows her own mind, where her lovers are concerned, and will blow hot and cold, and merry and sad, and cheerful and petulant, all in one breath as it were. Poor lovers ! they have a hard time of it with her as a rule. But youth is often so, and the cold still years, as they creep on us, with dull common sense and deadly reason in their train, cure us all too soon of our pretty idle follies. Just now she was bent on rebuffing him, but you see her strength failed her, and she spoiled her effect by the smile she mingled with the rebuff'. The smile indeed was so charming, that he remembers nothing but it, and so she not only gains nothing, but loses somethmg to the other side. "" Well, I'll try to mend all that,"" says he, but SO lovingly, and with such unaffected tenderness that she quails beneath his glance.",jessica,,
293,"He was not blind to the soft beauties of Isis, the first time he beheld her, and finding her fa- ther inflexible in virtue, he despaired of possessing her in any way, while such a protector lived ; therefore he had a dou- ble motive for removing Vedova out of his path. It was not likely Isis and her mother could ever be informed of any transactions within the Inquisition, and of course the treachery of Leolfo could not be suspected. His errand was, to feast his eyes once more with the deli, cate charms of Isis, before he fixed his determination. Her father once re- moved, he saw no obstacle to his wishes, and putting on the mask of friendship, he offered his protection to those he had plunged in the bitterest wo. He ap- peared to take a friendly leave, promi- sing to see them on the morrow. As donna Vedova knew not of the part part Leolfo had acted, she did not in- quire of him intelligence of her husband; but the moment Gustavus entered, she read the fatal news in his sunken eye and altered countenance. — """,jessica,,

303,"Lady Sylvia seemed to be very earnest on this matter. After all, said she, it was the lot of women to suffer. Those who seemed to be most fortunately placed in the world had doubtless their secret cares ; there was nothing for it but to bear them with a brave heart. A wife could not lessen the anxie- ties of her husband by sharing them ; she would more probably increase them by her womanly fear and exaggeration. It was not to be expected that a woman should be constantly intermeddling in affairs of which she could not possibly be a fair judge. A great many wives thought they were neglected, when it was only their excessive vanity that was wounded : that was foolish on the part of those wives. U.s,w, Lady Sylvia talked bravely and gladly.",jessica,,
308,"But his father, of course, will have a voice on this point, which brings me to the strongest reason I have to offer for your coming down here. I know, as well as you do, my dear friend, that your doing any thing for her in the way of giving money (excepting just for a few smart dresses) is perfectly out of the question, — nor do I believe that she expects it. But this may not be equally clear to Colonel Dermont, and when the offer has been made in form, which we are hourly expecting, he will doubtless think it proper to communicate with you. Now it strikes me, that the only means of avoiding such a direct application as must be replied to by a direct answer, will be your coming amongst us in person. And then, you know, nothing can be easier than for you to say, not as a matter of business, but as mere affectionate chit-chat, that if Amelia marries well, and to your satisfaction, you shall ever treat her as your own child ; and so I dare say you will — for were she ten times your child, you could not give her what you have not got. Should the colonel desire you to specify what you will do for her, I shall recommend you to reply that it is not your intention to do any thing during your life, but that you shall take care to do your duty by her in your will. What renders your making this effort exceedingly desirable, is the disagreea- ble fact, that Amelia is so deeply in debt as to render it probable she will be arrested, unless the speedy prospect of a good mar- riage shall set her various creditors at rest, as to their doubts of obtaining payment.",jessica,,

318,"But what good would you do, after all? The time has gone by for that sort of thing. I shouldn't like to have on my hands a woman sulking because she was married by force — ^besides, you can't do these mad freaks now — there are too many police-courts about."" ""By force?

333,"Three Bohemian brothers, a Robin Hood, a Mail Guard, and a Rural Policeman were not a little puzzled at the Great Mogul's empressement. for though they knew him as Captain Doleful, M.C., they had no idea who the gentleman was in the turban and trousers. The red folding-doors now kept flapping like condors' wings, as Highlanders, and archers, and deputy-lieutenants, and Hamlets, and sailors, and Turks, and harlequins, and judges, and fox-hunters, came shouldering and elbowing in with variously-dressed ladies on their arms,—Russians, Prussians, Circassians, Greeks, Swiss, and Chinese—a confusion of countries all speaking one tongue. Captain Doleful was pushed from his place before the doors, and nobody ever thought of asking for him, so intent were they on themselves and each other. “Bless me, is that you?”—“Who'd have thought?”—“Mar, here's James!” “Oh, dear, and William Dobbs!”—“What's your dress?” —“Beautiful, I declare!”—“Your pistols arn't loaded, I hope?”—“Splendid uniform!”",jessica,,
338,"But for this, and the moral cheerfulness imparted by a number of books and papers scattered about the room, it was even less inviting than the generality of Roman lodgings. The Bishop gave his visitor the only arm-chair, and then seated himself, crossed his legs, and smoothed his apron, before he said — *' The matter I wish to speak to you upon, Mr. St. John, is a delicate one. You are, I be- lieve, a cousin of Mrs. Goldwin's V and, I know, are very intimate with her, and also, I believe, with Lord Athelstone ?"" St. John assented by a movement of his head, and the Bishop continued — "" Some time since. Lady Athelstone, for whom I have a great regard, asked me to volunteer some advice to her son. I felt he might justly consider it a great liberty, as I was not — and am not now — upon terms to warrant such in- terference ; and I pointed out to his mother that meddling in young men's private affairs, with- out very grave cause, seldom does any good.",jessica,,
343,"There was one expedient against which I was absolutely determined, disguise. I had experienced so many mortifications and such intolerable restraint when I had formerly had recourse to it, it was associated in my understanding with sensations of such acute anguish, that my mind was thus far entirely convinced: Life was not worth purchasing at so high a price! But, though in this respect I was wholly resolved, there was another point that did not appear to me so material, and in which therefore I was willing to accommodate myself to circumstances. I was contented, if that would insure my peace, to submit to the otherwise unmanly expedient of passing by a different name. But the change of my name, the abruptness with which I removed from place to place, the remoteness and the obscurity which I proposed to myself in the choice of my abode, were all insufficient to elude the sagacity of Jones, or the unrelenting constancy with which Mr. Falkland incited my tormentor to pursue me. Whithersoever I removed myself, it was not long before I had occasion to perceive this detested adversary in my rear.",jessica,,
348,"""But, as you have a curiosity concerning some of these things, I may take the opportunity of adding, that so largely is our English language embued with the French, and especially with the Norman French of the era of the Con- quest; that, as I have been assured by a Norman Frenchman of scholastic turn, if an ordinary Englishman were to pass through the country parts of Normandy, so as to compare the ancient Norman witli the modern English, he could scarcely fail to understand every word that he should hear. And (as, indeed, it ought to have been expected,) it might seem, that the modern or Parisian French, has receded from the Norman dialect, while the modern or English has pre- served it ! He gave me, as an exam])le, the country-Norman pouquette, which is the Eng- lish pocket. The modern French, in the mean time, is poche^ for which the Norman must be jjouque ; and it is from these two words that we receive poke and pouch. As to the ancient diffusion of Norman French over every thing English, except that which even under the Con- quest retained its rusticity, and what is a further proof, that our Latin derivatives have usually come to us through the French, it may be ob- served; not only that the Jlesh of almost all the animals we eat, changes names from the Bri- tish and Anglo-Saxon to the Norman French, as it passes from the fields and farms to the town and table ; but that our very words meat and hutcher are French, and have taken the places of ^r.s7i Rudjlesher, which latter, however, are still used in the northern parts of our island. In this manner, instead of * flesh,' we say ' meat,' which is French ; and, instead of the ' flesh' of a sheep or an ox, 'beef and 'mutton,' which are Freiicli.",jessica,,

363,"that's to say if God spares her!” “She would not have known it, even if you could have told her this last fortnight,—ever since you went away she's been thinking always that she was a little child at her mother's apron-string. She must have been a happy little thing; it was such a pleasure to her to think about those early days, when she lay old and gray on her death-bed.” “I never knew any one seem more happy all her life long.” “Ay! and how gentle and easy her death was! she thought her mother was near her.”",jessica,,

Heaven knows, youth and happiness last not long : why shoukl we, by anxiety and ill-temper, misemploy the one and mar the other ? Love should b^ light, gay, and joyful ; a pleasure and an amusement.

383,"Possessing too the instincts of a sleuth-hound, no difficulty deterred her in working out a line of cold scent, and even sometimes in throwing her tongue freely when the scent had all but failed. No wonder, then, that, at a tea-party that same night at Buckbury, she hesitated not to announce, but of course confidentially, to a few friends, the private engagement of Frank to Mary Cornish. "" Talk of people being born,"" she said, "" with silver spoons in their mouths ; that girl has found a golden one in hers ! But, oh ! how I should like to be a mouse behind the tapestry at Watercombe, just to hear what Lady Susan, with her proud spirit, says of the affair ! though I don't feel certain that she knows all about it as yet.

The Baron was a man of fashion, not only in his dress, his taste in which was generally looked up to, but also in all those acquirements which the licen- tiousness of the age deemed necessary appendages to a man who moved in the higher circles of life, and which we now should justly style libertinism and debauchery.",jessica,,
393,"The young men were brought before the con- suls. When they were accused of plotting to bring back the king, and the letters found by Valerius were read aloud, and the story of the slave Vindicius had been heard, they did not dare to say that they were not guilty. The people were sorry for Brutus when they saw his sons led before hirn to be judged, and some said, — ""Would it not be punishment enough if the young men were banished for all their lives from Rome ? "" Collatinus, the second consul, shed tears, and Valerius did not speak a word. But Brutus looked sternly on his sons. ""Titus and Tiberius,"" he said, ""why do you not answer to the accusation these men bring against you ?

458,"There is a certain class of persons — narrow in mind, affectionate in temperament, and pene- trated with vanity — to whom generosity is easy but obligation impossible. When the question is of spontaneous assistance to a superior, there are no bounds to the good they will do, so long as they can peacock themselves with the thought that they have ministered to the god and fed the king's son. But let that god lose his divinity and show himself shorn of his rays — let that king's son be cast down from his throne and thrust into the mud — let divinity and royalty be brought to the base level of the once proud protector, then claim continuance of that former protection — and the scene changes. It is no longer a matter for vanity, for self-gratulation, for self-peacocking. It is not protecting the superior ; it is simply helping the equal — maybe the inferior. The gifts which were tribute become now the doles which are charities, and by this change of character lose their charm. Duty is not so pleasant as free- dom ; and the king's son in rags is not like the king's son in ermine and purple.",jessica,,

They were gaily painted on the outside, and covered in with glass roofs and sides. I think I never experienced a more enjoyable sensation than whilst rushing over the country in this tiny vehicle, surrounded by gay and pleasant companions, protected from the intense cold with- out by the comfort that reigned within the little glass abode. We were sitting on the engine it- self, whose blazing fire kept us at a most com- fortable temperature, although all without was a glorious scene of ice and snow ; every tree was frosted, and nothing to be seen for leagues and leagues but that solemn snow-covered land- scape ; relieved by the dark pine-trees and forests of evergreen on the tops of some of the high mountains. Now and then we would come upon a long train — a line of cars they would call it here — humbly drawn up on one side of the road to allow our three little spinning engines to fly past unmolested ; for the telegraph was kept at work incessantly during the two days of our most original excursion, to give warning of our approach, and convey the order from the Directors, who were of our party, to suspend all traffic on the line until we had rushed past. Suddenly would occur a deep bend on the line and a curve which would cause the first engine, our leader, to pass in a parallel line with us, as if retracing its steps many yards below us — that was a pretty sight, as we rushed wildly after each other through this ghostly-looking universe of snow ! Then again we would come to an immense mountain, up whose perpendicular sides our fairy engines had to climb !",jessica,,

"" It really is very good of him to trouble himself about Charlie's business at all,"" remarked the good lady; "" in fact he don't deserve help or pity from any one."" """,jessica,,
693,"Her first words make him change this view of things. ""My dear Mr. Giflbrd,"" she begins, in her bright, electrical, young Avay, ""(/o forgive me for putting your interest before your pleasure ; I am going to take you away from Ethel, and introduce you to the Bishop and Miss Tem- pleton : he is a martyr to the gout, you know, the dear old thing, and if you are called in at the Palace, the whole of Aller- ton Towers will be sending for you ; Ethel, Miss Templeton has been sitting alone for the last ten minutes ! I can't be everywhere, can I ? "" she continues, appealingly ; "" so you must sacrifice yourself a little to our guests."" "" The Bishop hasn't the gout at the present moment, so he dosen't want me, and Miss Templeton is exercising her maidenly wiles on Townley's new cub, so she doesn't want Ethel,"" Walter Gifford says, in a way that implies, under these circumstances, he means to keep Ethel to himself — apart from the others — a little longer. Mrs. Heatherley makes a face expressive of excruciating suffering, and then explains the cause of it. """,jessica,,
698,"As he passed into the chapel, to receive the vesture, and holy benediction, from the superior of the Ceuta brethren. he found Santa Cruz and his family kneeling before the altar, to unite their orisons with that of the priest. The supplications of the veteran were fervent, though silent ; and, as he prayed, he often turned his eyes on his daughter, who knelt by him, with her face concealed in her veil. The abbot put his hands on the head of Louis. The Marchioness wept ; for she had no faith in this expedition, and thought within herself — "" So he sanctifies the youth- ful martyr ! From that den of infidelity he never will return ! """,jessica,,
703,"you, so old a stager ? and not know the customs of shipboard ! "" pretending to think it a capital joke, and still struggling to get hold of the young girl's arm. Seeing that this pretty brother-officer of mine, was carrying his annoyance too far, I coughed aloud, but he was too intently engaged to hear me. "" Custom of shipboai'd,"" returned the mother, interposing her brawny arms. "" Marry, forsooth ! and what of them, Mr. Lieutenant? — that you should go to insult an honest woman's daughter."" "" Insult, you old fool !",jessica,,
708,"""And do you prefer London to Paris ? "" "" Le Lapon prefere sa hutte a un palais."" Here Lionel Crouch was somewhat at a nonplus, for mistaking Lapon for Lapin, he could not quite understand the allusion. He, however, took courage, and continued — "" Are you fond of English society, coun- tess ? "" "" Elle me plait beaucoup, je vous assure; les Anglais ont tant d'egards pour les etran- gers ; ils s'en font une sorte de devoir."" The dinner passed off agreeably enough.",jessica,,
713,"""You must,"" she answered, ""or I can never be your wife; for I should never think that you really loved me, as long as you loved this mistaken dignity and this dreaded public opinion still more than me."" ""But what will your father say? And what could I reply ?"" ""Now we are coming to it. Let us forget public opinion, and think only of what papa would say, though you must see that papa is only public opinion in a smaller and more convenient compass."" "" He would say that I was a mean-spirited fellow, that I was an adventurer, that I had married you for your money, that "" "" Yes, he would say all that, and a great deal more, I dare say, and in still more offensive language.",jessica,,
718,"In fact, Society would have blushed to have been sup- posed to have even known the mere fact of her existence. Lady Joan invited this trio of sorry sinners to dinner because the songs and anecdotes tickled her palate ; because after Mrs. Grrimdy at tea she required mental tonic and refreshment ; because Konsoulet would make her own bust for nothing ; YOL. II. a because Victor Louche had always known a good deal about her ; because — there were fifty be- causes. Besides nobody knew of these bohemian banquets ; her servants never talked ; and if she were seen driving up to the little villa outside Porta Pia, where ]\IM. Ronsoulet and Louche were living together, she only went to have her bust modelled — that was all. ' Do you speak to that creature ?",jessica,,
723,"“Nonsense!” said Mrs. Wilson. “Don't talk in that silly way. My heart has a better right to break than yours, and yet I hold up you see. But, oh dear! oh dear!” with a sudden revulsion of feeling, as the reality of the danger in which her son was placed, pressed upon her. “What am I saying?

728,"You, that are the companion of his watch, must know whither he is gone. Go to him, and tell him what I have spoken. I will await his return ! '* ""His business is secret,"""" sneered the Hun.

733,"All right—See here it is, sir, —all right—done your work. So you see, madam, this gentleman is the true and sole heritor of all the land that your father possesses, with all the rents thereof for the last twenty years, and upwards —Fine job for my employers! —sorry on your account, madam—can't help it.” I was again going to disclaim all interest or connection in the matter, but my friend stopped me; and the plaints and lamentations of the dame became so overpowering, that they put an end to all farther colloquy; but Lawyer Linkum followed me, and stated his great outlay, and the important services he had rendered me, until I was obliged to subscribe an order to him for £100 on my banker. I was now glad to retire with my friend, and ask seriously for some explanation of all this. It was in the highest degree unsatisfactory. He confirmed all that had been stated to me; assuring me, that I had not only been assiduous in my endeavours to seduce a young lady of great beauty, which it seemed I had effected, but that I had taken counsel, and got this supposed, old, false, and forged grant, raked up and new signed, to ruin the young lady's family quite, so as to throw her entirely on myself for protection, and be wholly at my will.",jessica,,

748,"The dress of the chief was perfectly national. His trews and plaid were the tartan of his clan, and his bonnet was distinguished by a single plume of an erne. His attendants were dressed in the philabeg and plaid. The chief took St. Cldye by the arm, and the whole party went to Dunmorven castle. Dunmorven himself enquired parti- cularly how his son had fallen in bat- tle; and when they came to the castle, Lady Dunmorven and her daughters, to whom St, Clyde was introduced by the chief, welcomed their visitor as be* came their dignity and his rank. But no sooner had this ceremony ceased, than the dutiful and parental soul of the mother and her daughters turned on the fate of the lamented Vich Ean Dunmorven. It was clear to St. Clyde that this mother had not yet ceased to brood over the fate of her son, and the death of their brother had given the young ladies a large share of the wild abs- tracted mourner; indulging in an in- tensity of feelings ; stung with disap- pointed hopes ; maddening with indig- nation at the fury of murderous bat- tle ; and drooping with hopeless recol- lections of the days of childhood and youth which the lamented Vich Ean Dunmorven had passed under his sire's paternal roof.",jessica,,
