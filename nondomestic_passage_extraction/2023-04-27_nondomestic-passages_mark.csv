251,"It was amazing to me, that his sensations, so contradictory to the absurd crotchet he had taken into his head, did not convince him of his error, especially when so frequently com- pelled to act in obedience to long accustomed impulses. As, for instance, on my rising to go, he suddenly started from his chair, shook my hands, and accompanied me to the door, as if nothing had been the matter. "" Well now ! What do you think of that ? "" said I, triumphantly. "" Ah, ah !"" said he, after a puzzled pause, "" but you little know the effort it cost me ! "" * # * * He did not persevere long in the absurd way of putting on his clothes which I have just described ; but, even after he had discontinued it, he alleged his opinion to be, that the front of his clothes ought to be with his face ! I might relate many similar fooleries springing from this notion of his turned head, but sufficient has been said already to give the reader a clear idea of the general character of such delusions. My subsequent inter- views with him, while under this unprecedented hallucination, were similar to the two which I have attempted to describe.",mark,,
256,"The shore was bold and winding ; his steps sometimes circled round a jutting point, and the next moment descended into a grassy glen, while the stream ran calm and silently by. Seating himself on a moss covered rock, close to the water's edge, he watched the rays of the sun slowly steal over the scene. Hearing the soft sound of approaching steps, he turned, and saw Catherine Dawnay ad vane- ing along the shore. The calmness and fresh- ness of the morning had led her to choose this path, and she walked on slowly, unconscious of the presence of a being in the place. Her eyes were bent thoughtfully on the ground, and the rich colour that always wantoned in her cheek was heightened by the pure breeze; her air and step were those of a proud woman, yet of one whose pride at this moment was combated by a more master passion. ""Is it you P' 1 she said hurriedly, as her look was turned for a moment on his moveless figure. "" I had not thought to find a human being in this lonely path ; but midnight and sun-rise are your wandering hours.",mark,,

266,"I think I see your surprise when you read this — your utter incredulity ; and yet, my love, it is true. Some time, I may be able to explain the mys- tery of this ; in the mean time, believe any- thing rather than that I am acting basely — or even inconsistently with all I have spoken and written to you on these subjects ; for I swear to you that I had no thought of this till this very day — could not have conceived it possible that it should come before me, not only as a duty, but as an imperious necessity. God bless you, dearest — bless you all ! You shall hear from me soon again : in the mean time think as little badly of me as you can, and always love me. I have greater need of your love than ever."" Without intending, or even being himself quite conscious of the fact, George's letters to Lis sister had altered a good deal both in style and sentiment, in consequence of the feelings he had taken back to town with him at Christmas. There was less of the pretended hardness and customary slang in which young men often choose to indulge, to the injury and disguise of their natural sentiments, and a great deal more of truth and reality.",mark,,
271,"But tides and tidal trains, my dear, wait for no man, as you may not have learnt yet. There are a few odds and ends on the toilet-table. Pray accept them, with my blessing. No, I will not leave my address ; thank you for suggesting the pre- caution, all the same. Chatham-Dover, main line, cabman.' The mere thought of a trip abroad always put Henry in good spirits. He waved his hand quite festively to the girl, who had already decided that this was quite the ' pleasantcst-spoken gent' of her acquaintance.",mark,,
276,"Such was his mood of mind when the stable-clock struck ten — the hour when the post was due : and before long a tray of letters was brought to him. He had only expected one which could bear on his anxiety. Instead of one there were three. There was the one he expected ; he knew it must be her handAvriting ; he looked at the back, and there he saw her monogram. Besides that there was one from her eldest sister, and there was another from Mrs. Harley. He read the one from the eldest sister first. She accepted Carew's explanation with regard to the presence of Foreman, but slie did so in phrases of such studied coldness as to show that her displeasure remained, although the alleged pretext for it had been abandoned.",mark,,
281,"But I fear, this mean rapine, this ' itching palm,' as the English poet saith, which so infects the Republican Commanders, will induce me to rest contented with the good old virtues ; and even to compound with the prejudices of nobility afld hereditary rank. '' "" But, princes, dear Vittoria, can rob and oppress too,"" said Giustiniani. "" Si, si, good cousin : and that they do openly, under no cant of philanthropy nor professions of benevolence, but from the good old principle that seven-eighths of the world were made to serve the other eighth ; and. Heaven knows, that the ingrained marks of servility are stamped stronger on the wills, tar- lents, and propensities of the multitude, than all your boasted rights of equaUty and innate freedom are proved in the thousand-and-one dreams of moral and political philosophy."" "" What ! uttering such principles ?"""" ex- claimed Duvivier, "" and quoting English, moreover!

291,"Nothing more remained for them to do, but inr sist upon an ample apology in the next day's paper ; and after dictating such a one, as Fe- licia thought would not only vindicate Rosa- lind's reputation, but strike a terror in her ca- lumniators, she left the office with blended feelings of grief and shame. All that could be done to clear her sister's fame from so foul a charge had been achieved; but Felicia had learnt to approximate the most distant periods, and familiarize her mind to what might be the consequence of present events. She felt that the purity of a name once defiled, like a gathered floweret, fades away ; and its fresh- ness, its lustre, never return. Silent and de- jected, she reached the place where she had de- sired the coachman would wait their return, and without speaking, threw herself into the carriage. "" Who could have thought it !"" were the first words that burst from Rosalind, as she drew up the glasses, and the coach drove off. "" A little vinegar witch ! I always knew she was vain and pettish, but I had no idea she was so malicious a vixen.",mark,,
296,"I will not ask it now then, Walter ; but we must meet again. I could not die in peace if I saw you not ; and you must think of me as a father — a fond father, and receive from me a son's portion. It is a simple thought to become an author : you have saved me tens of thou- sands — you will not pain me by refusing part of what you have preserved ?"" "" Pardon me, this must not be !"" interrupted Gordon quickly. "" I would not pain you by refusing ; you must not pain me by the offer- ing. You had a claim on my services for your past kindness. On this point I am resolute :",mark,,

My whole soul has never consented—it does not consent now.” Stephen let go her arm, and sank back on his chair, half stunned by despairing rage. He was silent a few moments, not looking at her; while her eyes were turned towards him yearningly, in alarm at this sudden change. At last he said, still without looking at her—",mark,,

311,"The young physician had on his side youth, cheerfulness, hope, and a high purpose ; life was fresh to him, and the entire impetus carried him lightly over the rough places of a country doctor's practice. High practice and low practice, he took all as it came. Merrily he footed it across wet fields, down muddy lanes, across bare commons where wind and rain beat together upon the wayfarer. Nothing lowered his spirits. The most exacting of his poorer patients could not disturb his good-humour. He won everybody's heart, rich and poor ; and Dr. Jubilee, marking this, and finding too that the young fellow always upheld his principal's reputation with loyalty, whispered to Mrs. Marmaduke more than once that the lad was quite thrown away, madam, in this hole-in-the-wall sort of place. Sholto did not think so.",mark,,

At length, during a pause in their conversa- tion, footsteps were heard in the passage; and, on Henry turning eagerly to the door, he saw the object of his solicitude enter, accompanied by Charles. Susan was overjoyed to see him ; she knew that he and Edward were very intimate, and, therefore, did not doubt but he could tell her much of which she was most anxious to learn. On hearing that he was immediately about to leave them, she proposed to accompany him a little way on his return. This was what he very much desired ; and, therefore, without allowing her time to change her mind, ex- pressed his pleasure at the proposal, and bidding Mrs. Hayling and Charles "" Good night,"" took his departure. "" You will come with us, Charles ?"" said Susan, turning to him. ""No !"" replied Charles, somewhat doggedly, ""I am sorry I cannot !"" """,mark,,

326,"'Hollo! who's that?' cried Mervyn sternly. The figure opened his eyes, with a wild stare, as if he had not opened them for a hundred years before, and rose up with an uncertain motion, returning Mervyn's gaze, as if he did not know where he was. 'Who are you?' repeated Mervyn. The phantom seemed to recover himself slowly, and only said: 'Mr. Mervyn?' 'Who are you, Sir?' cried Mervyn, again. 'Zekiel Irons,' he answered.",mark,,

336,"Sir John, thoroughly bewildered, looked for advice to Colonel le Garde, who, how- ever, could only shake his head in reply. "" If you will only calm yourself, my dear young lady, and compose yourself sufficiently to supply Mr. Dasliwood and myself with a little necessary information, I will answer any and every question that you like to ask me, in return. Come,"" he added, trying with gentle authority to lead her to a seat, for he perceived that she was trembling vio- lently in every limb, and was obliged to sup- port herself by a convulsive clutch at the table, which was between her and the three men, whom she stood facing. ^' Come, sit down, my dear, for so I feel privileged to call you, for the sake of my dear old friend your late father, and let us discuss matters quietly.

356,"If I had my own way, you may be sure I should spend a good portion of my time tliere ; but people can't always do as they like in this world."" And Miss Foulkes sighed as she stroked the folds of the soft blue dress fondly. Very pretty and piquant looked this saucy little person to-day ; great care had been taken with the rich dark hair by the faithful, much-tasked maid, she had twisted and turned and rolled and plaited, till her fingers ached again. Miss Foulkes didn't wear her hair as most young ladies wear it now-a-days, in a great big fuzzy wisp at the back of their heads, that heavy dark hair of hers hadn't the least tendency towards curliness, or fuzziness, but swept off from her white forehead smooth and glossy, winding itself into such wonderful coils and twists at the back of her head, that it looked like a great big long boa-constrictor which had gone to sleep there coiled up, and had subsequently been pinned to the small head by those two big jet pins at each side. Fanny's strongest weapon, I think, was her hair. Such countless, mysterious ways as it had of twisting and arranging itself M 2 every day ! how very soft and glossy it was too, and how white it made the deli- cate throat look, as it nestled close on it, dark and thick; I don't think Miss Foulkes would have been anything with- out her hair ; her strength lay in it, like Samson, and she knew it too.",mark,,

366,"I soon found that she instantly employed the surest means of obtaining that object by spreading the report of a positive engage- ment between Emily and myself. Her maid was first made the depositary of the se- cret, and thence it proceeded upwards and downwards in all directions, so that ere din- ner-time, it had reached my own servant, who, while I was dressing, congratulated me on the occasion in all due form. From him also I first learned positively who was the rival aspirant to the hand of my sweet Emily ; for my mother (I suppose from fears of my vio- lence) had refused to tell me ; but my servant had been recommended to me by no other than my worthy acquaintance, Alfred Wild, and now with tender malevolence, while he offered me his felicitations upon my approach- ing happiness, he took an opportunity of com- miserating the disappointment of his late master and patron. The day ended happily, Albert Wild did tiot make his appearance, Emily's mind was calm, and mine was full of hope and delight. The idea of visiting the continent was not at all disagreeable to me. I would certainly rather have taken Emily with me, but I had a great deal of the boy still in my nature, and many and marvellous were the pleasures which I anticipated from my short tour. Whi- ther I was to direct my steps, became the first question, but that was soon decided.",mark,,
371,"She has not suffered ? She is happy still ? "" '' She is well ^'—coldly. How should it be explained to this man that his child had a heart easily moved to gratitude and pity ; that she had suffered patiently and greatly in watching and sooth- ing Anthony Blake's decline ? That which might have been feared for her, the too early awakening of love through gratitude and pity, had not befallen her, through Tony's ow^n self-renunciation and jealous care for his child-love's peace. With a long-drawn sigh of relief, Helen Staroska had seen the cloud that for a moment had threatened to overshadow the young girl's springtide pass harmlessly over her.

376,"He was asking himself, with a half laugh at his own simplicity, why this must be — whether it might not be worth while to make the surroundings of the workshops less hideous — when his eye was caught by one of the labourers passing between him and the grimy wall. Xo skilled workman this, like those in the blackened moleskins, which, at the beginning of the week, were white, with their free step and independent aspect. The man was one of the drudges of the establishment, a skilless hanger-on, doing jobs as they were wanted, carrying the great, rusty bars of iron, bringing coals, doing all the rough work of the place. He was dressed in the indescrib- able clothes of the British labourer, who has no sort of habitual costume, not even a blouse under which to hide his rags, with a red cotton hand- kerchief knotted about his neck. Perhaps it was this bit of cotton that caught John's eyes : and then it seemed to him that the face above it was not unknown to him. It was a sufficiently vil- lainous face ; the features looked as if they had been roughly shaped out of some coarse paste, the small eyes, looking out from under shaggy brows, with a sidelong glance, the slouching gait, the unshaven chin, made up a very un- attractive picture altogether. s 2 ' Where can I have seen him V John said to himself.",mark,,

Tom Jarndyce—you'll excuse me, being related; but he was never known about court by any other name, and was as well known there, as—she is now;” nodding slightly at his lodger; “Tom Jarndyce was often in here. He got into a restless habit of strolling about when the cause was on, or expected, talking to the little shopkeepers, and telling 'em to keep out of Chancery, whatever they did. ‘For,’ says he, ‘it's being ground to bits in a slow mill; it's being roasted at a slow fire; it's being stung to death by single bees; it's being drowned by drops; it's going mad by grains.’ He was as near making away with himself, just where the young lady stands, as near could be.” We listened with horror. “He come in at the door,” said the old man, slowly pointing an imaginary track along the shop, “on the day he did it—the whole neighbourhood had said for months before, that he would do it, of a certainty, sooner or later—he come in at the door that day, and walked along there, and sat himself on a bench that stood there, and asked me (you'll judge I was a mortal sight younger then) to fetch him a pint of wine.",mark,,

401,"The children were very familiar with every syllable of this ballad, which had been often fully explained to them. They danced in a circle with the burden of every verse, shouting out the chorus with good articulation and joyous energy; and at the end of the second stanza, where the traveller has his nose pinched by his grandmother's ghost, every nose in the party was nipped by a pair of little fingers. Mr. Chainmail, who was not prepared for the process, came in for a very energetic tweak, from a chubby girl that sprang suddenly on his knees for the purpose, and made the roof ring with her laughter. So passed the time till evening, when Mr. Chainmail moved to depart. But it turned out on inquiry, that he was some miles from his inn, that the way was intricate, and that he must not make any difficulty about accepting the farmer's hospitality till morning. The evening set in with rain: the fire was found agreeable; they drew around it. The young lady made tea; and afterwards, from time to time, at Mr. Chainmail's special request, delighted his ear with passages of ancient music.",mark,,

One was on foot, but all the rest were mounted; and Dudley, to his surprise, re- cognised in the pedestrian the vigorous form of Xorries, whom he had thought full twenty miles away. The young wanderer advanced at once from under the mimosas to meet his deliverers ; but as he came nearer, the aspect of one of the horsemen seemed fami- liar to his sight.

I find no pleasure, therefore, in taxing the English with departing from nature in their external appear- ance, which is all I yet know of their character; it in possible they only endeavour to improve her simple plan, since every extravagance in dress proceeds from a desire of becoming more beautiful than nature made B ; and this is so harmless a vanity, that I not only pardon but approve it. A desire of being more excel- lent than others is tvhat actually makes us so; and as thousands find a livelihood in society by such appetites, none but the ignorant inveigh against them.

He had been the first to see the upsetting of the boat, and was the first to reach the floating men ; and when De Witt called to him to retire, and to abstain from lending assistance, he re- mained swimming about, round and round his master, in an agony of apprehension. The submersion was a tolerably lengthy one, and the first boat was none too soon for one or two of the men, who were growing exhausted with the effort of holding on to a slippery surface whilst being knocked about so roughly by the angry sea. Barrington, however, was little the worse for his plunge ; his circulation was sufficiently good and his arms suffi- ciently athletic to make the situation less trying to him than to most men, whilst his nerves were proof to stand against a tolerably severe test.

531,"Her hearer, nursing his knee and gazing at her with his head a little on one side, was thinking what an enviable, not to say admirable, specimen of the human genus she was. Nobody could call her selfish; she was evidently wrapped up in her children and quite unsuspicious that other people might be bored by long disquisitions upon their several perfections and imperfections ; still it could be surmised that her buoyant temperament would tide her comfortably over any calamity that might be in store for them or her. She was one of those thrice happy few who are content to let things happen to them, who do not attempt to control the course of events very much, who have but a slight sense of personal responsibility and who are almost incomprehensible to the nervous and anxious amongst their fellow-beings. Mrs Frere was not at all incomprehensible to Matthew; but he could easily believe that she might be that, and provoking into the bargain, to her daughter. The more he saw of this really delightful and amiable family, the more he realised the complete isolation in which one member of it must necessarily dwell, 'Of course it is her own fault,' he mused; 'but one can no more help faults of that kind than one can help being tall or short, fat or thin.' When you come to think of it, the number of things that can be helped is quite astonishingly small.

By the road-side, I passed some of the bodies of those who had fallen in the skirmish of the morning. Stripped by the peasantry, they had lain all day sweltering under a burning sun ; and now the vultures were screaming and flapping their wings, as they settled in flocks wherever one of these poor fellows lay unburied, with his blackened and gory wounds exposed to the gaze of every passer-by.

At this juncture she received a letter from For- tescue, urging her to come down to them, if it were only for a few days, as he thought Julia grew worse and worse ; colder and colder to him she certainly did.

Here was an opportunity of avoiding going to the ball, without impro- priety, and without seeming to do so in deference to her lover's opinion, or oUt of regard for his feelings ; and thus principle and pride would both be satisfied. Accord- ingly, she ordered the carriage and post- horses to come round directly, and instead of going to Mrs. Seebright's, where she was expected, as her father had left London early that morning, she wrote that lady a note to desire her to make her apologies to Lord L. and sent another to Lord Restor- mel to tell him she was gone to Clifton, and should not return to London, being sick of it and gaiety, and then departed for Clifton to clear up, if possible, the strange, mysterious cause which seemed likely to prevent a union very near her heart, or at least to watch over the declining health of the friend most dear to that heart.",mark,,

616,"To confess the truth, I had so far suffered prejudice to get the start of unbiassed liberality, that I had almost assigned to these rude people scenes appropriately barbarous; and never was I more pleasantly astonished, than when the morning's dawn gave to my view one of the most splendid spectacles in the scene of picturesque creation I had ever beheld, or indeed ever conceived—the bay of Dublin. A foreigner on board the packet, compared the view to that which the bay of Naples presents: I cannot judge of the justness of the comparison, though I am told one very general and common-place; but if the scenic beauties of the Irish bay are exceeded by those of the Neapolitan, my fancy falls short in a just conception of its charms. The springing-up of a contrary wind kept us for a considerable time beating about this enchanting coast: the weather suddenly changed, the rain poured in torrents, a storm arose, and the beautiful prospect, which had fascinated our gaze, vanished in mists of impenetrable obscurity. As we had the mail on board, a boat was sent out to receive it, the oars of which were plied by six men, whose statures, limbs, and features, declared them the lingering progeny of the once formidable race of Irish giants. Bareheaded, they “bided the pelting of the pitiless storm,” with no other barrier to its fury than what tattered check trowsers, and shirts open at the neck, tucked above the elbows, afforded; and which, thus disposed, betrayed the sinewy contexture of forms, which might have individually afforded a model to sculpture, for the colossal statue of a Hercules, under all the different aspects of strength and exertion.This little marine sketch is by no means a fancy picture; it was actually copied from the life, in the summer of 1805. A few of the passengers proposing to venture in the boat, I listlessly followed, and found myself seated by one of these sea-monsters, who, in an accent and voice that made me startle, addressed me in English at least as pure and correct as a Thames boatman would use; and with so much courtesy, cheerfulness, and respect, that I was at a loss how to reconcile the civilization of his manner to such a ferocity of appearance; while his companions, as they stemmed the mountainous waves, or plied their heavy oars, displayed such a vein of low humour and quaint drollery, and in a language so curiously expressive and original, that no longer able to suppress my surprize, I betrayed it to a gentleman who sat near me; he assured me that this species of colloquial wit was peculiar to the lower classes of the Irish, who borrowed much of their curious phraseology from the peculiar idiom of their own tongue, and the cheeriness of manner from the native exility of their temperament; “and, as for their courteousness,” he continued, “you will find them on a further intercourse, obsequious even to adulation, as long as you treat them with apparent kindness; but an opposite conduct will prove their manner proportionably uncivilized.”",mark,,

He will rally again, and be happy with another.” They all met, and were introduced. Captain Harville was a tall, dark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and from strong features, and want of health, looking much older than Captain Wentworth. Captain Benwick looked and was the youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them, a little man. He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air, just as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.",mark,,
686,"I have said we had many letters that day, and so we had, forbye the ill-favoured ones that came seeking siller — tidings from most of the family, and a big letter to me from Oakenshaw. I was very anxious about this myself, seeing it was the first 1 had heard, except one small letter, asking how I was, from Grace ; and 1 took it to the corner of the window to read it in quiet, while Mary and Mr. Allan were holding counsel, and truly, as it is easier for me to put down Grace's words, than to tell the same story in my own, I will write it all here. "" Rhoda's lover has come to Oakenshaw."" (This was what Grace wrote to me.) "" That is to say, I am led to the conclusion that he is Rhoda's lover, from his coming here, and from the perpetual warfare which both of them seem to think perfectly legitimate and appropriate. They are a strange couple, and I smile to think of them under your wing, and marvel at your patience, my dear aunt.",mark,,

696,"I had no idea that I should miss her so much ! Indeed we all missed her ; it seemed to me now that I had undervalued her. True, she had not been a congenial companion to me in my dark days ; but even then I had wTonged her. Why should I have expected her to grope among the shadows with me, instead of following her into the sunshine ? Sara could not act contrary to her nature ; sad things depressed her. She wanted to caus3 every one to be happy. Her feelings were far deeper than I had imagined them to be, I liked the way she spoke to JiU when she was bidding good-bye to us all.",mark,,
701,"At this period, by circumstances too tedious to be enumerated, I became acquainted with Marigni, and the high-minded Minister admitted into his noble breast a sentiment of friendship for the hum- ble Jongleur whom he considered talented. "" 'The likeness of the statue to the King was surpassing, but still, being of alabaster whiteness, it appeared like unto the dead. Proud of his work, Marigni presented it to the Queen-mother, who gratefully received it ; alas ! soon after, Philip le Bel came to his death by a fall from his horse while hunting. The Queen-mother, in deep woe, imputed the sad event to the summons of the Grand Master to her son commanding him to appear before the throne of grace. Not so Charles Count de Valois : being on bad terms with Marigni, he sent forth strange, but as yet whispered insinuations. These reached the ears of Enguerand, and addressing me he said, ' De Lor, I really find such pleasure in this work, I cannot give up the pursuit, at all events until the forms I have commenced are finished.",mark,,

731,"Lady Maria affected to be shocked by her flippancy and insubordination ; and within a week, the seminaiy "" on a limited scale"" was hastily selected; Minnie and her trunks were securely deposited there as animate and inanimate lumber, which might very well be spared from Seymour-street ; while her mo- ther and sisters began to enjoy, unmolested, their own witty enmity against her former bene- factors. Lady Willingham, meanwhile, was particu- larly gratified by this apparent alteration in her young protegee's destiny. Despite the icy list- lessness of her middle age, she was not an un- <»,; £ observant woman ; prosperity and adversity had equally tended to soften her heart; the bril- liancy of her position in life had served to ex- pand the original narrowness of her mind ; the faults of her youthful temper were somewhat moderated, and she had already detected so much that was mischievous in the character of her sister-in-law, so much that was objection- able in the acquired tone of her nieces, that she rejoiced to know her little favourite was secure, for the present, from the evil influence of their example. Maiy, however, w^as more charitable, or less discerning. She was wonderfully im- pressed with the elegance and graces of her travelled cousins ; and was herself of so ino'e- nuous and liberal a disposition, that it never occurred to her to suspect the existence of infe- rior qualities beneath so specious a surface. Modestly, though silently, conscious of her own personal defects, she admired their beauty, their foreign graces, their trifling accomplishments, nor deemed it possible that they could have been left wholly ignorant, in all those unavail- ing branches of education which were likely to remain inostensible. Eleanor, indeed, who was gifted with brilliant abilities, had contrived to pick up some curious stores of general informa- tion in an unchecked course of desultory read- ing; but Claudia, with her music and her miniatures, her melting Roman intonation, and her polished Parisian idiom, remained a dunce of the first water.",mark,,

746,"To find that he had cared for her in earnest was a complete surprise to her. She was a girl who was remarkably free from the common female attribute of vanity, and was not at all likely to imagine any admiration of herself as existing, un- less it were expressed very plainly indeed. He had never told her right out that he cared for her, nor had he in any other way made ^his sentiments evident enough for her to perceive them. Since the time of her coming out, her life had been amply filled by the business entailed upon her by this new phase of ex- istence — the business of assimilating some things to herself and herself to others, by which process her character was being un- consciously transmuted and formed whilst still retaining its own original individu- ality as the foundation. In all that ap- pertained to this, she had been too fully occupied to have time to trouble her head with speculations as to whether any par- ticular person liked her or not, or to what extent the liking might go. She had always supposed that Mr Sylvester must think her tolerably agreeable because he seemed to like to be with her ; but she attached no further importance than that to his fondness for her society. She had generally found him pleasant, and had learnt to recognise that he possessed a strange power of attraction that was pecu- liar to himself",mark,,
