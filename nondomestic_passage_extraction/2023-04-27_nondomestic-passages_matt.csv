255,"Will not the reader tire, if I should minutely describe our long-drawn journey from Paris to Geneva? If, day by day, I should record, in the form of a journal, the thronging miseries of our lot, could my hand write, or language afford words to express, the variety of our woe; the hustling and crowding of one deplorable event upon another? Patience, oh reader! whoever thou art, wherever thou dwellest, whether of race spiritual, or, sprung from some surviving pair, thy nature will be human, thy habitation the earth; thou wilt here read of the acts of the extinct race, and wilt ask wonderingly, if they, who suffered what thou findest recorded, were of frail flesh and soft organization like thyself. Most true, they were—weep therefore; for surely, solitary being, thou wilt be of gentle disposition; shed compassionate tears; but the while lend thy attention to the tale, and learn the deeds and sufferings of thy predecessors. Yet the last events that marked our progress through France were so full of strange horror and gloomy misery, that I dare not pause too long in the narration. If I were to dissect each incident, every small fragment of a second would contain an harrowing tale, whose minutest word would curdle the blood in thy young veins.",matt,,
260,"“If I talk or am silent, is there any change?” Yet he lay quiet for a long time. The light through the open door showed him to her, where he lay, with his arm thrown across his eyes. At last he spoke. Perhaps it was relief to him to speak. To Bloemfontein in the Free State, to which through an agent he had traced them, Gregory had gone. At the hotel where Lyndall and her stranger had stayed he put up; he was shown the very room in which they had slept.",matt,,
265,"He went forward the more carelessly, I must suppose; for presently we saw him sink a little down, draw up his feet and sink again, and so twice. Then he turned his face to us, pretty white. “Lend a hand,” said he, “I am in a bad place.” “I don't know about that,” says Ballantrae, standing still. Dutton broke out into the most violent oaths, sinking a little lower as he did, so that the mud was nearly to his waist, and plucking a pistol from his belt, “Help me,” he cries, “or die and be damned to you!” “Nay,” says Ballantrae, “I did but jest. I am coming.”",matt,,
270,"Let the world be fully apprized of it, lest there should be some mistake or doubt about it here- after."" Mr. Robinson would have looked foolish, but that his consternation was too great to admit of the manifestation of any minor emotion. He arose, and walked to the door of the office, which he opened stealthily, and having satisfied him- self that neither Jeffries nor his companion, Hunsman, were listening, a frailty to which the former, as Robinson well knew, was especially prone, he silently returned to his seat. *' Well, Mr. Robinson."" said Bouverie, after a long pause, taking out his watch ; '* my time is precious. I presume the business between us is for the present settled. I am now about to call upon my solicitor, to whom I beg to refer ^ou in the further stages of this m.atter.""",matt,,
275,"It is necessary to say a word or two about Mrs. Norris. She had been a singer of some eminence ; and between her professional talents and, we may add, ses beaux yeux, very discreetly applied, had realized an income sufficient for her wants and those of her daughter, and which permitted her to indulge in some few luxuries besides, exclu- sively of the little suppers — to one of which we are about to introduce the gentle reader. Mrs. Norris was quite a person of good cha- racter, not such, perhpas, as would be personified in the beau ideal of Mrs. Chapone, or of Mrs. Hannah More, but still, as has been said, she had made use of ses beaux yeux with such un- common discretion, that the most censorious persons could find nothing worse to say of her than that, during ten years of her life passed in Italy for the improvement of her singing and for her health, she was very much admired, very gay, and delightfully amiable. Some, indeed, thought she was more particularly appreciated by a noble- man of large fortune, devoted to the fine arts; but nothing certain was ever known on this score. The said nobleman married precisely at the same period that Mrs. Norris's husband returned from America, where he had been acting Othello and King John, George Barnwell and Scrub. Mr. Norris, however, was a wretch of whom we will not speak, for all agreed that he behaved scandalously to his wife, and, in fact, he was said to have abandoned her. As to Emil}-, who was born during the ten years, — Mrs. Norris's ten years in Ital}^",matt,,

285,"Having effected the reunion of Raymond and Perdita, I was eager to return to England; but his earnest request, added to awakening curiosity, and an indefinable anxiety to behold the catastrophe, now apparently at hand, in the long drawn history of Grecian and Turkish warfare, induced me to consent to prolong until the autumn, the period of my residence in Greece. As soon as the health of Raymond was sufficiently re-established, he prepared to join the Grecian camp, near Kishan, a town of some importance, situated to the east of the Hebrus; in which Perdita and Clara were to remain until the event of the expected battle. We quitted Athens on the 2nd of June. Raymond had recovered from the gaunt and pallid looks of fever. If I no longer saw the fresh glow of youth on his matured countenance, if care had besieged his brow, if his hair, slightly mingled with grey, and his look, considerate even in its eagerness, gave signs of added years and past sufferings, yet there was something irresistibly affecting in the sight of one, lately snatched from the grave, renewing his career, untamed by sickness or disaster. The Athenians saw in him, not as heretofore, the heroic boy or desperate man, who was ready to die for them; but the prudent commander, who for their sakes was careful of his life, and could make his own warrior-propensities second to the scheme of conduct policy might point out. All Athens accompanied us for several miles.",matt,,
290,"Yes, but,"" the others began at once, "" clo you want to go and do likeAvise ? "" <fc Yes I do in a way,"" shouted Torrington, jumping up. ""I don't want the thing to smell exactly, but I want to do what I can do best. And I'm a morbid analyst by nature, a dissector, a vivisectionist, and I hate the Young Person most devoutly. But these poor ignorant beasts don't know who the Young Person is."" And he launched into a consecutive diatribe against the novelist's bugbear, which was wonderful considering he was undoubtedly drunk. Presently he stopped and looked at his audience.",matt,,
295,"“They crack the City bubbles and bladders, at all events,” Mr. Fenellan said. “But if we let our journals go on making use of them, in the shape of sham hawks overhead, we shall pay for their one good day of the game with our loss of the covey. An unstable London's no world's market-place.” “No, no; it's a niggardly national purse, not the journals,” Mr. Radnor said. “The journals are trading engines. Panics are grist to them; so are wars; but they do their duty in warning the taxpayer and rousing Parliament. Dr. Schlesien's right: we go on believing that our God Neptune will do everything for us, and won't see that Steam has paralyzed his Trident:—good!",matt,,
300,"Lizzie's defences were entirely overthrown. Her look of indignation faded off her face, to be replaced by a quick crimson blush, which as rapidly disappeared and left her features as pale as marble. She made a hurried step towards her brother, and fell sobbing on his neck. "" Oh ! Bertie, Bertie !"" she sobbed out, be- tween a series of little gasps. "" There, there, don't cry ! my darling little Lizzie.",matt,,
305,"This seems to me a very strange and unhappy affair altogether,' he exclaimed sud- denly, relieving himself of the tension on his mind and throwing himself into a chair. ' Since you give me such generous license, I may explain myself fully. I heard an extraordinary rumour to-day. It was to the effect that your husband had once been en- gaged to marry Mrs. Severn. Of course I did not give it a moment's credence, but it is most unfortunate that any slanderous rumours should arise now and form the nucleus of a scandal. Cynthia, you know that for you to be associated with such would be a heavy grief to me.' '",matt,,

320,"— and I'd rather be a rude tomboy than a great girl, bai Jove, Mr. Max!' cried Nelly; whereupon Mr. Bray laughed, Mrs. Bray scolded, and Nelly pretended to cry, directing a comical look the while at her father, who, whatever his weakness, was passionately fond of his girls. The crunching of the gravel by the wheels of the wagonette put a stop to the rather unpleasant scene, when, to Laura's surprise. Max jumped up and handed Ella down to the carriage, returning afterwards for his sister, who favoured him with a pe- culiarly meaning look ; one which he replied to in as supercilious a manner as he could assume. ' What does it mean, Max ?' she whis- pered, as they descended the stairs. ' More affection for your little sisters?' 'My dear Laura,- drawled Max, ^",matt,,
325,"It seemed as if hell had sent forth its legions. And now hundreds raised their voices, uttering awful impre- cations, pelting me with bats, sticks, mud. In a few moments I must have fallen a victim to the populace had not my men-at- arms cut a passage for my escape through the crowd, not, however, without injury to several of the mob. From that hour my popularity was gone, and I became an object of hatred to the people by whom I had so lately been worshipped. Freida, I have dwelt on this scene ; for though at the time it caused in my heart no sentiment but indignation, my mind now often reverts to it. To be brief, for I feel exhausted ; all in which I engaged from that period proved unfortunate. The war with Flanders, solely regulated by my counsels, was unsuccessful ; the spirit of Louis broke under my tyranny, and which he had not sufficient energy to cast off.",matt,,
330,"The guards were doubled in and about the palace ; a regiment of trusty soldiers was summoned from Stirling and quartered in the town to be ready for any emergency to co-operate with the royal guards ; the King did not stir abroad, but took his exercise in the quadrangle, and that only when the troops were under arms. The Queen passed through the town several times, with no more than her ordinary attendants, as if to show her con- fidence in the people ; but it was noticed that the good lady was unusually pale, and that despite her effort to seem content, an expression of sorrow was on her counten- ance. It was pitiable to see the anxiety with which she watched her son. Prince James, then only aged about eight years, and who, in happy ignorance of the brood- ing turmoil around him, was blithe and mischievous as a child should be. Several nobles fled from the court at the first tidings of the catastrophe, and fearing that they might be implicated in it, either took immediate refuge in France, or in their own strongholds, gathered their re- tainers about them, and prepared for war. Others of the barons remained doggedly in attendance — amongst them Angus — but there was gloom upon their brows ; they wore stout hauberks of steel under their coats, they had various weapons secreted about their persons, so that whilst they appeared to wear only their swords — to which they were restricted in the presence of the King in time of peace — they were in reality armed to the teeth ; and they kept their followers ready to spring to their rescue at the first bugle note of alarm. This state of matters continued for several days, during which nothing de- cisive occurred.",matt,,
335,""" exclaimed she. '' Yes, I met Alice ; at least,"" said he, stooping down to settle the log on the fire, ""I saw her the last evening I was at Naples."" "" Tell me all about it."" "" There's no all. I met her, we talked together for half an hour or so, and we parted ; there's the whole of it."" "" She had heard, I suppose, of your good fortune?"" "" Yes, Skeff had told them the story, and, I take it, made the most of our wealth ; not that rich VOL.",matt,,
340,"What had become of her ? If living, she would be grown up by this time. But Nanny had certainly never heard of her before, and she came to the conclusion that, having been born in India, and therefore delicate, she must have died in childhood. She looked again at the letter, examin- ing it carefully. In spite of the feminine absence of a written date, the fine sloping, angular handwriting, the thin discoloured note-paper and faded ink, and the creases into which the letter had worn, testified to its being at least a quarter of a century old. She was poring over these indica- tions by the light of the lamp on the mantelpiece, when a soft step behind startled her, and caused her to turn. Old Mrs. Ryder was standing there, with her faded blue eyes fixed in curiosity and apprehension on the letter in her daughter-in-law's hand.",matt,,
345,"Hardly had they begun to speak to him than there was a shout, and they saw a body of shepherds descending the hill. There were three hundred of them; warned by the messenger, the whole country had risen to repel the gipsies. Too late to join in the fight, they had seen the last of it. They examined the field. There were ten dead and six wounded, who were taken prisoners; the rest escaped, though hurt. In many cases the arrow had gone clean through the body. Then, for the first time, they understood the immense power of the yew bow in strong and skilful hands.",matt,,
350,"She was spared what keeps alive so long the prostrating sorrow of many a bereaved mother, — namely, the having nothing to do, S— 2 where she had been till then so fully occu- pied. She was spared the sight of a vacant cradle, and of tiny baby clothes no longer of any use. Her hands, as she said, were full; and that is the best thing to prevent the heart's being so. Still it was a dreadful day to both Natt and Polly Lynn, the day of the funeral. In most instances the coffin -lid shuts the little one out of the father's heart, and into the mother's for aye. The grey lid of Baby Poll's coffin shut her into the hearts of both her parents. Polly never nursed or dressed the little healthy lovely foundling without thinking of Baby Poll and her wasted form.",matt,,
355,"Nelly was gone, there could be no doubt, but where? If she had fled with Lord Fitzowen, he would have known how to act. If she had taken sanctuary in her aunt's hotel, he could have extricated her from that unsavoury refuge, with a certain loss of dignity, perhaps, but an undoubted accession of authority for the future. In either case his course would have been clear. But now she had baffled him completely. How could he return to Koyston Grange without his wife ? How reply to the inquiries of a whole neighbourhood that she had gone away from him, he didn't know where?",matt,,

370,"But as neither Mr. Beaumont nor Al- bina,"" she artfully added, "" would hearken to any suggestions of mine on the subject, and, out of mistaken good-nature, insisted on my silence to you on it, I must expect that whatever your determination may be. from what I have said, you do not let it be surmised that it is owing to any thing you have heard from me."" Fidelia solemnly promised observance of this admonition, but not without being* cruelly shocked by what she had heard. Was she then regarded in so equivocal a light, that she could not with propriety or regard to her own feelings enter society? But she could not doubt the assertions of Mrs. Beaumont, and consequently decided, from pride and delicacy, on keeping her- self retired. But the promise she had made to Mrs. Beaumont placed her in a very awkward predicament ; her positive refusal to be one of the party to Rock Fort, after the pleasure she had previously evinced at the idea, without assigning any reason for this refusal, occasioning not only surprise, but also displeasure in the minds of Mr. Beaumont and Albina.",matt,,
375,"The three figures in this strange group remained fixed, silent, and aghast, for several seconds. Mrs. Marston endeavored to speak; but, though her lips moved, no sound escaped her; and, from very weakness, she sank, half-fainting, into a chair. Marston rose, throwing, as he did so, a guilty and furious glance at the young Frenchwoman, and walked a step or two toward the door; he hesitated, however, and turned, just as mademoiselle, bursting into tears, threw her arms round Mrs. Marston's neck, and passionately exclaimed, ""Protect me, madame, I implore, from the insults and suspicions of your husband."" Marston stood a little behind his wife, and he and the governess exchanged a glance of keen significance, as the latter sank, sobbing, like an injured child into its mother's embrace, upon the poor lady's tortured bosom. ""Madame, madame! he says--Mr. Marston says--I have presumed to give you advice, and to meddle, and to interfere; that I am endeavoring to make you despise his authority. Madame, speak for me.",matt,,
380,"He told her that she was his hope, his treasure ; the one only joy of his life ; that it would be a sin to doubt her ; and Blanche listened in fear, and prayed that the love which was fixed upon her, might in mercy find a surer resting-place, and then humbly asked if she might tell him all that she had done. It was a tale soon repeated, soon understood, and Blanche was happy when she heard her father's whispered blessings ; but she did not discover how- much cause he had for thankfulness himself. She did not remember the load which must be taken from his heart by the knowledge of the cause of her de- pression ; and she did not perceive the reverence which her firmness and consistency of character in- spired. Lord Rutherford thought little of religion himself, but he could now apprecia e it as a principle in others ; and with Blanche he would have shrunk from the careless bestowal of his patronage, as from an injustice against a charge entrusted to him. Silence followed : the peaceful silence of hearts w hich arc one in affection and conlidence. ""Blanche,"" said the carl at length, "" it was excitement w hich made you so ill. Your aunt says you ought not to have come down-stairs, the night of the ball.""",matt,,
385,"The intense excitement which she had felt when the news of the Battle of Belgrade had reached Paris having subsided, she was less anxious and agitated than she had been, but totally unable to take part in the gaiety of that family circle which had once been so dear to her. Her old friend M. de Bonrepos was more devoted than ever. His attachment to her had assumed a touching character. The most painful compassion was mixed with it. She had ceased now to resent this, though for worlds she would not have owned that her fate was not an enviable one. As in former days, he tried by every means in his power to amuse her, to win from her a smile. He sometimes succeeded, but, somehow, there was very little that was cheering in those smiles.",matt,,
390,"But that did not trouble him; he had never thought himself very large or important, and he was quite willing to accommodate himself even to circumstances which rather overpowered him. Perhaps he had never looked so little a fellow as when seated now in his great chair, at the end of the table. Notwithstanding his solitary existence, the Earl chose to live in considerable state. He was fond of his dinner, and he dined in a formal style. Cedric looked at him across a glitter of splendid glass and plate, which to his unaccustomed eyes seemed quite dazzling. A stranger looking on might well have smiled at the picture—the great stately room, the big liveried servants, the bright lights, the glittering silver and glass, the firece-looking old nobleman at the head of the table and the very small boy at the foot. Dinner was usually a very serious matter with the Earl—and it was a very serious matter with the cook, if his lordship was not pleased or had an indifferent appetite.",matt,,
395,"But scarce had they had time to compare the most cursory notes, before the arrival of the second steamer was announced; and Madeline, with all that unselfishness which distinguished her in everything she did, tore herself away from Otho, her husband, to go on board and meet Nellie. She could not allow her to arrive and find no one there to greet her. And Madeline had requested Otho not to accompany her on board. Since Nellie had left for Syria, this terrible affair of Gould's bigamy had taken place ; and Madeline felt that such a painful disclosure — for it must be made sooner or later — should be made privately. As Madeline went off in the boat to the steamer, the contrast between her situation and that of the woman she was going to meet, forced itself irresistibly on her ; and still more so, the singular coincidence that this same villain of a man of whose crime she was to be the unwilling messenger had been the prime mover in all her, Madeline's, misery. It seemed as if her reward and his crime were to be meted out in the same day. But Madeline's only consolation in the painful scene which lay before her was the knowledge that Nellie, though she might be shocked to hear of such a scandal, would not suffer in her heart ; for she knew that that heart held no sentiments for Gould but those of loathing- and repugnance.",matt,,
400,"My dear child,' he said, in a husky, hesitating voice, for, though he had often dashed with his men at the charge full into the dangers of the battlefield, he felt a peculiar sensation of nervous dread now at having to broach the business upon which he had come. ' My dear child,' he began again. ' My dear uncle,' she answered, tenderly. * You know my feelings respecting your approach- ing marriage ?

415,"When they commenced their deliberations, they spoke separately, each, when he had any thing to say, standing up, and generally, but not always, addressing himself to an elderly warrior, who appeared to be their principal sachem, or king, but who had nothing in his dress to distinguish him from the rest. What each man said, was communicated to the French by an interpreter; by which means Charles became acquainted with their various sentiments, and the progress and management of the consultation. The first proposal made was to sacrifice half of the prisoners according to their customs, and to give the others to the French; the division to be made by lot. To this the French refused to assent; and one of them standing up, addressed them to the following purpose: “Brothers! you say it is to please your departed warriors, that you would sacrifice these men. Where are those warriors now! Are they not in heaven!",matt,,

425,"Lady Ormleen had felt her heart beat somewhat quicker than beseemed this marble tranquillity of deportment ; — she had found the hurried words perplexed in her utterance; — she had experienced that dull, blank vacancy which oppresses the mind, then, when some well-graced lover quits the room. It was one night at a ball at the Duchess of Gordon's in Piccadilly, that a young man of highly prepossessing appearance was presented to her by a certain good-humoured old Lady Shetland, who qualified her formal nomination of "" Captain Dal- rymple"" with a scarcely audible whisper of — "" I dare say, my dear Lady Ormleen, you have heard all about him ; — Lord Inverarie's eldest son, you know."" Her young ladyship bowed, without pleading guiltj^ to her ignorance on the subject. Feeling that Lord Inverarie's eldest son was a very proper partner for her ; and finding in Cap- tain Dairy mple the most amiable, the most cul- tivated, the "" wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best,"" of all those who had hitherto guided her steps through the mazes of the cotillon, she permitted herself to smile with greater warmth, and talk and listen with greater freedom, than she had ever done before. There was something very fascinating in the dignity of his fine countenance, occasionally, but rarely, illuminated by a burst of enthusiasm in the utterance of a noble sentiment — the description of a beautiful object. And then he was a bit of a hero. He had shared a leaf of the laurels of the great Rodney, in his triumph over De Grasse; and was just returned from Paris, where he had assisted in the theatricals of the Petit Trianon, and learned to talk with rap- ture of the blue eyes of Madame de Lamballe, — with feeling of the graceful accomplishments of Marie Antoinette.",matt,,
430,"In- deed it would appear so, for on the day of my approach to G — — — — h the morning was fine, the noon rainy, the evening cold, and the night, be- sides its usual irradiation, was illumi- nated by ignited and curious meteors, which sometimes vibrated in the north- ern sky, and sometimes shot along the lower regions of the air, in every direc- C 9 tion, with surprising velocity and un- common magnificence. -n P — e seemed to make a kind of involuntary homage to these phaenomena, by striking his sails. And it was but a just tribute, for a storm of rain soon followed, accompanied with vivid flashes of lightning, and roaring peals of thunder, dreadful to every au- ditor, except to the good man, and the British sailor, who, being strangers to guilt, are therefore strangers to fear. However, the calm that succeeded the storm, the mild and mellow effulgence that was issued in by the sun the follow- ing morning, made the face of the county of K — t, a kind of heaven upon earth. Nor could any-thing be more favorable to my landing at G ' — h, or to afford the g m — t and the people an opportunity of receiving me with all that pomp and ceremony which they deemed due to 'my rank and to the occasion which brought me amongst them. Indeed if any-thing could have re^ conciled me to my destiny, it would have been the manner of my reception at G h; I was received at the landing place by the highest dignitaries of the c h and s — e, of the army and navy; the bells rung, a r — I sa» tute was fired, and the people cheered me with as much enthusiasm, as if they expected my union with the Mar- quis capable of multiplying the happi- ness of the land.

440,"it is, that since Madame de Vaugirarde will not come to court, your Majesty should go to Madame de Vaugirarde."" It was not very difficult to make this notion agreeable to the king. It had one ingredient plea- surable enough to secure its good reception — it was new — nobody had ever before dreamt of bis Majesty making a tour into the provinces incog. This was quite sufficient ; and Richelieu had scarcely detailed his intentions than the King burned with impatience to begin his journey. Tbe wily mi- nister, however, had many things to arrange be- fore they set out; but of what nature he did not reveal to his master. Certain is it that he left for Paris within an hour, hastening to the capital with all the speed of post-horses. Arrived there, he exchanged his court suit for a plain dress, and in a fiacre drove to the private entrance of the Theatre Francais.",matt,,

I saw even then that his life had been a sad one — not a good useful life, though he softened it down to suit what he thought I, his hearer, ought to listen to. It was not that he wanted to make himself out better than he was — that was never Douglas's way, never — but he had a man's tender reverence for a girl's ignorance of the world, and of evil. For his own sake — he was so true by nature, so earnest and manly in his humility and repentance for the past, — that for his own sake I think it would have been a relief to him to speak out strongly and boldly — to paint his life as black as he believed it to have been ; but he never let himself go ; he never forgot me and my happy uncon- sciousness of the sin and sorrow in the world. Yet he never excused anything that had been wrong — he was himself always, — himself, "" tender and true."" And as I loved him, and even then saw how noble he was, — saw that where he had fallen he had most bravely, most humbly, raised himself again ; that the excuses he would not make for himself were yet shadowed forth unconsciously in his own words, I, Diane de Beaurepaire, longed greatly that the world should understand him some day, — at least such a portion of the world, a very small one, it is true, as loved, praised, or blamed him.",matt,,

The sun of a summer day had risen over the summit of Sliabh Owen, and the first breeze of morning had brushed the surface of the bay, when almost all the population of the sept of O'Haedha had assembled in the valley of Rath-Aidan. By the gay and eager faces of the multitude, and the frequent jests that passed from lip to lip, it might be judged that the occasion was a festive one. The gates of the Rath stood open, and were guarded by two lines of armed galloglachs, who restrained the crowd, and kept an open .space clear, as if for some expected cavalcade. The sound of the piobh mala, a kind of drone- kss pipe, somewhat resembling the national in- strument of the Scottish highlands, the fuller tone of the ndharcaidh ciuil, or musical horn, and other wind instruments, were heard from various recesses of the valley, and every sight and sound betokened the commencement of some splendid pageant. • At length, the long, loud note of a single goU- trompa from the Rath, produced an instant still- ness through the multitude. It was succeeded by a sudden shout so stunning and so universal, that the sea-fowl wheeled and screamed in startled flocks along the shore, and the echo mut- tered like thunder among the distant peaks of Sliabh Miskisk.",matt,,

Such a pro- posal as that from his mouth had not entered into their estimate. The major part drank up their taps, and seized the first opportunity that presented itself of departing out of the back- door ; so that, in ten minutes after the land- lord's proposition had been made, there were none left except two or three old aleskins, who, it was notorious to the parish, drank until they had not a penny to give : they did not fly, be- cause they were not in any danger.

But when they reached the summit of the Veitsberg, and beheld the Abbey and Lake of Laach lying far away at their feet, the boy grew faint, and declared himself incapable of stirring another step.

This was the question which he tried to answer, but which perplexed him the more deeply he pondered upon it. One thing was clear — he must see his wife, and endeavour, by menaces or promises, to turn her from her expressed purpose. How he could contrive to effect this without arous- ing Mrs. Emmerson's suspicions was more than he could decide upon at that moment ; but, in any case, it must be done, he decided. Chance favoured him, however, for in two or three days afterwards — days which were spent by him in a state of great doubt and alarm — a letter came from Edmund Mon- tressor, dated from the same place in Lon- don, stating that he had been robbed of all his money whilst travelling on the Conti- nent, and asking for another two hundred pounds, to enable him to tide over his affairs until the end of the year.",matt,,

Hang me, if I know what to make of you ; you are so stern and stuck up of late."" And off walked the discomfited husband, leaving his stately wife fully determined to maintain her dignity in a family w^here she plainly saw the permission on her part of any infringement of it w^ould expose her to dis- agreeable consequences. The marriage-ceremony, according to the English law, was solenniized in a few^ days after, with as much pomp as was admis- sible where a certain degree of privacy was necessary ; and, before it was celebrated, Mr. Hunter, senior, had a very liberal marriage settlement drawn up in favour of his daugh- ter-in-law, securing her, and any offspring to which she might hereafter give birth, most ample provisions. Honor's politeness to- wards her husband and his parents was in- variable ; but, while it left them nothing to complain of in their ordinary intercourse, it never relaxed into that sociability and confi- dence which form so great a charm in do- mestic life. Her beauty and dignified de- meanour had made such a favourable im- pression on Mr. Hunter, senior, that he was disposed to excuse, if not to overlook, the want of cordiality which sometimes struck him in his daughter-in-law. "" It's her way,"" would he sometimes say, in reply to the frequent comjdaints of his wife on this point. """,matt,,
660,"clothes, and a watch the Captain had himself presented to the unfortunate Sir Henry: who, they informed him, had that morning been interred, A tear fell on the cheek of the Cap- tain as he resigned the hope so lately raised, of hearing of — and seeing his Ellenor; accompanied by one for the unhappy fate of his favourite St. Ledger : nor did the severity of Mr. Talton refuse the tribute of a sigh : the faults of Sir Henry sunk beneath the sod which en- circled him, and left to his remembrance only the youth he regarded iipr the sake of his mother. With his mind deeply depressed, the Captain returned oo board; long had had he experienced unhappiness, but the events of the last week had struck the shaft still deeper in his heart; nor could the friendship of Mr. Talton, or the affection of Frederick, preserve him from a corroding melancholy. The death of Sir Henry, as St. Ledger, was universally regretted ; even the obdurate Harland, for a moment, forgot his enmity, and expressed a senti- ment of pity; whilst the generous Fre- derick, who had regarded him with fra- ternal friendship, paid that tribute to his memory his merits demanded ; and whilst he dwelt with praises on the name of his friend, the faltering accent and half-suppressed sigh evinced the sin- cerity of his grief for his loss. Mr, Mr. Talton finding the impracticability of his endeavours to alleviate the sor- row of the Captain, took his leave, and set out for London, to acquaint Lady Corbet with the death of her son : as, however disagreeable the task, he rather chose to inform her himself, than hazard an abrupt disclosure from an uninte- rested person, or even by epistolary communication. The Captain felt relieved at his de- parture, as he wished to visit the grave of Sir Henry, but was unwilling to be- tray the weakness of his heart, even to his friend. The ensuing morning, therefore, he went on shore, and, unat- tended, pursued his way to the church- yard; where a simple flag of fragrant turf turf marked the spot where the remains of the unfortmiate youth were laid.

695,"The princess was very much gratified to hear these words, by which she plainly saw that her handsome deliverer was not indifferent to her beauty; but as she was very discreet and mo- dest, she replied, "" Anything that I can bestow might have been yours a minute ago, but before I can grant you any other favour, which I have no scruple to confess I am very willing to do, you must render me some other piece of ser- vice, which will be an excuse to my friends, w^ho are not without their share of pride. But in the mean time, come with me, that you may see the power I have given you, and give me your hand, that we may not lose each other in the sea."" At this request Saidy was very much puzzled, for he was afraid of wetting his clothes, and did not like to take them off before the princess ; but she perceiving his confusion, told him not to be afraid, for with the power she had bestowed upon liim, the sea would not touch him in the least. Accordingly, he gave his hand to the young lady, who led him forward to the edge of the rocks, which were pretty high thereabout, and in a minute both plunged into the waves, which did not at all discompose Saidy, who was SO well accustomed to diving ; but after a while, he was very much surprised to find that he could breath and speak as well under the water as on land ; and that they passed from one place to an- other with a rapidity truly astonishing. At first, when near the shore, and in the mid- water, he perceived a great number of fishes, some very cu- rious, that he had never seen before, such as one which had the skin of a cow, another which had two heads, and a third which was a sort of flat fish, and had its mouth in the middle of its body, and four eyes on each side, that it might see its prey the better. All these, however, got out of the way as fast as they could, when they saw Saidy and the princess coming; and when the two had got to the bottom, which was a good way out, Saidy found quite a different region, where there were no fish of any kind, and it seemed a fine country, just like those on the face of the earth; in some parts being covered with small sand, and in others with large stones and pebbles, which Saidy discovered to be all kinds of jewels, in the rough; and in other places were rocks and mountains, some quite bare and naked, and others all growing over with various sorts of sea-weed and beautiful water-flowers, which, from their novelty, appeared more elegant and fine than any of the earth.",matt,,
