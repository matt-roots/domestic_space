254,"I say, he's — he's — very quiet, isn't he ? "" asked the breathless equestrian, as the horse sidled away amongst his old friends the hounds, snorting, shaking his head, and "" reaching "" at his bridle, in a manner which much discomposed the security of his rider's seat. "" These large horses require a deal of holding,"" added he, half ashamed of his want of skill in the manege^ as, with mounting colour, he knotted his reins and crammed his hat down upon his head in a '' do-or-die "" sort of fashion which was anything but suggestive of a pleasant .excursion ; but the Doctor was now in for it, and being a gallant little fellow at heart, there was a game sparkle in his eye that, with all his misgivings as to the result, showed he ""meant mischief."" My attention, however, was soon taken up with the many and onerous duties of my posi- tion ; and, after mucli consultation with the sporting agriculturists who constituted my field, we hastened to dispose ourselves over the surrounding country, and spread abroad in every dKcction, peeping into furrows and lash- ing turnip-tops, in the orthodox manner of performing that not very enlivening ceremony denominated *' drawing for a hare."" The farmers were a capital set of fellows, thorough sportsmen one and all ; the country, a ^^dld district, with few resident landlords, and totally unpreserved. Com^sing was a favourite amusement with the aboriginal in- habitants ; and I have no doubt that whenever a poor man wanted a brace of partridges or a pheasant, he went to look for them without more ado. All this might be very pleasant, but, as may be supposed, was not conducive to the superabundance of game.",svenja,,

264,"Oh, it's nothing ! — He'll get well fast enough. Upon my soul, I did not think you cared much about him ; and the insult to Marion quite put him out of my head. I dare say, we shall hear in a day or two, that he is as well as ever."" I could gather little more from his idle, unconnected way of talking, and a mysterious paragraph in the newspapers, in which no names were given. The next morning brought me more accurate tidings.",svenja,,
269,"Even in the old Palazzo, a guest of this description had been occasionally received, and had sat discussing some point of antiquarian lore, or something about tlie old books at Colla, with her father without taking any notice, beyond what civility demanded, of the little girl who sat at the head of the table. She did not doubt it would be the same thing to-night ; and though Markham was always 7iice, never leaving her out, never letting the conversation drop altogether into that stream of personality or allusion which makes Society so intolerable to a stranger, she yet prepared for the evening with the feeling that dulness awaited her, and not pleasure. One of the guests, however, was of a kind which Frances did not expect. He was young, very young in appearance, rather small and delicate, but at the same time re- fined, with a look of gentle melancholy upon a countenance which was almost beautiful, with child-like limpid eyes, and features of extreme delicacy and purity. This was something quite unlike the elderly antiquarians who talked so glibly to her father about Eoman remains or Etruscan art. He sat between Lady Markham and herself, and spoke in gentle tones, with a soft affectionate manner, to her mother, who replied with the kindness and easy afFectionate- ness which were habitual to her. To see the sweet looks which this young gentleman re- ceived, and to hear the tender questions about his health and his occupations which Lady Markham put to him, awoke in the mind of Frances another doubt of the same character as those others from which she had not been able to get free.",svenja,,
274,"The road to Earlshall led through plantations that belonged to the Earl: the sound came in that direction, and I hoped it might be some one coming in search of us. As the sound came nearer and nearer, I was almost sure I could distinguish Ginger's step; a little nearer still, and I could tell she was in the dog-cart. I neighed loudly, and was overjoyed to hear an answering neigh from Ginger, and men's voices. They came slowly over the stones, and stopped at the dark figure that lay upon the ground. One of the men jumped out, and stooped down over it. “It is Reuben!” he said, “and he does not stir.”",svenja,,
279,"It was not thus when we marched and fought in perfect con- cord, and no haughty superior fettered our hand and heart."" "" True, Trevanion ; each sacrifice and priva- tion was then sweet ; there was not a jarring string in the host."" "" And why is it not so still, Sir Beville ? why are those days of devoted counsel and pur- pose yielded to the present time of hesitation and indolence ? It ought not so to be ; the royal cause is sacrificed to these delays, — to this want of conduct as well as daring that now haunts our every step. By heaven ! we shall soon become a ridicule and bye-word to the people, whose bread we eat, and on whose in- dustry we have battened."" There was bitterness in his tone as he spoke, and the spirit of the young soldier, it was evi- dent, was chafed to the uttermost ; the free and frank expression of his features had changed to that of sullen and suppressed indignation.

284,"He contented himself with evinc- ing his disgust passively only, but often and often he wished that the boy lay buried beside his mother, and ^vished it with a concentrated passion that would have amazed himself had he realised its intensity. If Philip were dead his father would be free to wed again, and then a son after his own heart might be born to him. But neither words nor wishes kill, and Philip, having been tenderly nursed during his infancy by a healthy foster-mother, grew stronger year by year ; and, while Philip was alive, he, and he only, could be the heir to the baronetcy. Sir Stephen stands prepared now to read prayers to the domestic circle, who have gathered around him in so quiet and orderly a fasliion. The bright morn- ing sunshine, which streams straight into the room, throws his tall, well set-up figure into strong relief against the back- ground of dark oak-panelHng. The lines of his face are as hard and firm as those of his form, and neither relenting nor yielding seem possible to either. His features resemble those of Hubert, but are cut clearer, and with more decision, and he is like his plastic brother in no other respect.",svenja,,

294,"I would fain have the man asked,"" said La Tremouille, "" if he knows by whom those bands are commanded, led, or instigated."" "" I know nothing but by common report,"" re- plied Antonio, "" and she is a stumbling jade upon whom it is not well to rest weighty matters. However, she sometimes stumbles right, and the general rumour throughout the whole country was that his eminence the Cardinal Caesar Borgia was at the bottom of the whole. Certain it is that the men who stopped and robbed the muleteer professed themselves to be his soldiers."" "" I cannot believe it,"" said the king; "" he was wrong in leaving our camp it is true, when he had voluntarily surrendered himself as a hostage, but in all our communications he showed re- verence for the crown of France, and professed respect and affection for our person."" A slight smile came upon the lips of several of the counsellors, who had learned by experience the difference between professions and realities, but no one ventured to assail the king's opinion, aud shortly after Antonio was dismissed; but it was only to give place to the king's provost, who came to report very unmistakable signs of mutiny and sedition in the city of Naples itself. From his account it appeared that even those who had been most discontented with the Arragonese princes, and had greeted most warmly the en- trance of Charles into Naples, longed for the res- toration of the old dynasty, and were, step by step advancing towards revolt. "" They are an ungrateful people,"" said Charles ; "" have I not freed them from taxes and burdens insupportable?"" """,svenja,,
299,"I will tell her the truth about those infernal verses, menace death, blood, and danger, and then---” Here he fell back into a charming revery; the wily fellow knew what power such a circumstance would give him over a poor weak girl, who would do any thing rather than that her beloved should risk his life. And with this dastardly speculation as to the price he should ask for refraining from meeting Fitch, he was entertaining himself; when, much to his annoyance, that gentleman again came into the room. “Mr. Brandon,” said he, “you have insulted me in the grossest and cruellest way.” “Well, sir, are you come to apologise?” said Brandon, sneeringly. “No, I'm not come to apologise, Mr. Aristocrat: it's past that.",svenja,,

309,"Philip received one day an invitation for a ball from Lady Marshfield, and in reply begged for an invita- tion for his friend Arthur Challoner. Arthur, being still in suspense about his Chancery money, was unwilling to go to the cost necessitated by such an invitation, besides wishing not to divert his mind from his studies. But Philip, not satisfied with urging it himself, enlisted Mr. and Mrs. Berner on his side. He assured them that Arthur ■wanted a little enlivening, and they joined him in his request. Arthur at last yielded, somewhat against his will, and thought it very kind of Philip to be so anxious to secure him amusement. But there was always an underlying design in Philip's actions. As on the day when he took him to his father's, so this time he was desirous of parading his friend before Lady Marshfield, and of giving her a favourable idea of his own kindness and amiability.",svenja,,
314,"I'll have some of them little black prawns now."" He pointed to a dish of French prunes. Fred helped him, and asked for further reminiscences. "" There was a rat in the pear Bunny got, a little rat with black eyes, and a fat white body. Me and Bunny squashed him ; but he'd lived in the pear a long time, so we got anuvver and some 'nanas, same as those there."" "" D'you like bananas ? "" """,svenja,,
319,"Catherine was greatly obliged; but it was quite out of her power. Mr. and Mrs. Allen would expect her back every moment. The general declared he could say no more; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded; but on some other day he trusted, when longer notice could be given, they would not refuse to spare her to her friend. “Oh, no; Catherine was sure they would not have the least objection, and she should have great pleasure in coming.” The general attended her himself to the street-door, saying every thing gallant as they went down stairs, admiring the elasticity of her walk, which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing, and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld, when they parted. Catherine, delighted by all that had passed, proceeded gaily to Pulteney-street; walking, as she concluded, with great elasticity, though she had never thought of it before.",svenja,,
324,"An endless vista of in- tricate law business seemed to open before his mind's eye now. ^^ If Mr. Gaskell could have foreseen such an emergency as this, no doubt he would have made preparation for it. It might be as well to ask Lady Joan if she knows of any docu- ment—will it could hardly be called — of her husband's drawing up,"" said the lawyer. * ' My mother insists on getting up, if only for a few hours, to-morrow ; but I shall scarcely like, yet awhile, to trouble heron this matter,"" said Herrick. ^' Any such document would, I should say, as a matter of course, have been deposited with you."" ^^",svenja,,
329,"It was the smile with which a man looks on his nearest and <iearest. "" I must never go and wish him good night again,"" she said to herself, with quick sensitive alarm. '' Of course he understood that Aunt Clemency sent me ; but, though he was very kind^ he did not seem quite Hke himself."" But Gloden never guessed how strong had been Reginald's impulse to call her back as she moved slowly away from him up the broad staircase, and to take her in his arms and pray her never to leave him again.",svenja,,
334,"IV. M iinually dwelt on the last conversation I had ever held with my father, and instead of rejoicing in it, as I certainly ought, since it afforded me the consolation of knowing that he was taken from this world to a better, in the way agreeable to his own wishes on the subject, I conceived that every word he had uttered arose from a presentiment of what was about to befall me, and that he had, in speaking of sudden death, foretold his own ; and in descanting on the greater misery attending wasting disease, had forewarned me of the fate of Adelaide, and probably of Charles likewise. From continually revolving this subject in mv mind, I obtained a terrible familiari- ty with it ; and as the jealous man ever seeks for the food which he feels to be poison, so my mind, weakened by suffer- ing, sought food to feed its sorrows, and apologize for their indulgence ; and as the kind hand of her who once snatched me from despondency was now unable to rouse me, and had no longer the same mo- tive for her own exertion, I went on my own way — either sunk in the listlessness of apathy, or the grief of despair. Charles, in the mean time, slowly reco- vered his strength, and the rose of health • faintly tinged his cheek; when lady Sedge- wood pointed this out to me as a comfort* my jaundiced mind instantly converted it into a source of sorrow; and I applied Mrs. Opie's lines to the case-^- u For health I saw in Henry's bloom, Nor knew it mark'd him for the tomb ;"" and from this time every indication he gave of health, I attributed to sickness; and by a parity of reasoning, I concluded that Adelaide was undoubtedly affected precise- ly in the same way; and that if ever her wanderings ceased> and I was permitted once more to cast my eyes on her lovely form, it would be merely to witness the same terrible beauty which lighted up the sunken eye, and painted the cheeks of those lovely victims which had so often M 2 awakened my compassion at the Hot-wells of Bristol. Under these reflections, my days were consumed with regret, my nights a prey to anguish ; and I glided round my paternal domains, rather like the ghost of some for- mer possessor revisiting them, than the ac- tual incumbent, called upon to fulfil im- portant duties, and occupy the place of the baronet.",svenja,,
339,"But Mr. Tracy could not con- vince himself. He had lived too long out of the sphere of the great world for its cold sophis- tries to have much weight with him. He felt that he was destroying his daughter's happiness, if not affecting her health, and endangering her life ; and the only tangible consolation he could apply to his own heart, was found in the reflec- tion, that she must herself have shared in the ruin which her marriage with Sir William Win- slow averted. General Tracy was not at Northferry. Mr. Tracy had, with a cowardice not altogether singular, concealed from his brother the com- pact between Sir William and himself, till the old officer was in London ; and had then written to tell him that Emily was engaged to the young baronet, and to be married immediately. Sheets of paper do not blush, which is a great relief to many who are doing weak, wicked, or foolish things. General Tracy had replied in a letter which Mr. Tracy had only read half through, and then burned, with a shaking hand ; but as the day of the marriage approached, and he knew bis brother would arrive before it, he be- came uneasy, irritable, listening for carriage- wheels, and evidently working his courage up for an encounter that he dreaded.",svenja,,

359,"But where is the army,"" asked Tilton, "" which might oppose the French force in the field ? As I tame along this day, I heard of a pasquinade of your Holiness's witty Ro- mans, in which a reward was offered to any person who could find the Imperial army, lost, in the month of October, in the mountains between France and Lombardy, and which had not since been heard of.^^ A hearty laugh, on the part of the Pontifi', greeted this sally; and his mirth was stiil more cordially echoed by Giberto, who ex- claimed aside to his master, "" What a pity that Schomberg* is not present to hear that!""

384,"I think my father was gratified by the Earl's attentions. He took them, very pro- perly, as a mark of approbation of his pro- fessional skill ; and the knowledge that he had done his utmost under trial, was the greatest comfort he was at that time capable of ex- periencing. His grief for my gentle mother sank very deep into his heart. I am not aware exactlv how long the Earl's regret for his wife lasted ; all I can positively say is, that, like most sorrows, it came to an end. In less than two vears he had married again, and •J O ' the frequent demands upon his property, the raised rents of his tenantry, and the felling of timber, gave proof that he was leading a gayer life than ever.

Lucy saw, with a sudden sensation of fright and pain, an unknown crowd of possibilities which might pour down uj)on her, were it to be communicated to Sir Tom that his wife and her brother were debating as to a course of action on her part, unknown to him. All this occurred in a moment, and it was not any lucid and real perception of difficulties but only a sudden alarmed compunctious consciousness that filled her mind. She fled, as it were, from the circum- stances which made these horrors possible, hurry- ing back into her former attitude with a peni- tential urgency. Jock, indeed, was very dear to her, but he was no more than second — nay, he was but third, in Lady Kandolpli's heart.

409,"If he agrees to pay us a certain pak'^"" Q 2 of what he gets that is not the Company's affair at all. When we made the arrangement with him we were not promoters of the Com- pany. The Company agree to pay him so much ; tliey pay it, get their property in return, and then the matter is at an end, so far as they go. All this may have some show of reason in it, and in fact held water for a considerable time ; for of course it may well be that a would-be vendor of property is perfectly justi- fied in remunerating the man who obtains him a purchaser ; but then, to make this all right, the purchaser must be a rational independent being, having a capacity to judge of the matter for himself. But, as distinguished from this, the fatal point to the Leroy tribe was, that, having made their arrangement with the vendor, by which the purchase-money was to be largely increased, and in part paid to them, they did not make the sale to any independent person or corporation, but proceeded to form a com- pany for the express purpose of buying the property on the terms agreed ; and this com- pany, being at the outset their own creation, as we have seen, had really no separate con- trol over the affair, but adopted, as a matter of course, the arrangement which was the very object for which it had been called into existence.",svenja,,

479,"The public cannot have forgotten how ill that sensitive gentleman bore the attack that was made on him in the columns of the Jupiter, with reference to the income which he received as warden of Hiram's Hospital, in the city of Barchester. Nor can it yet be forgotten that a law-suit was instituted against him on the matter of that charity by Mr. John Bold, who afterwards married his, Mr. Harding's, younger and then only unmarried daughter. Under pressure of these attacks, Mr. Harding had resigned his wardenship, though strongly recommended to abstain from doing so, both by his friends and by his lawyers. He did, however, resign it, and betook himself manfully to the duties of the small parish of St. Cuthbert's, in the city, of which he was vicar, continuing also to perform those of precentor of the cathedral, a situation of small emolument which had hitherto been supposed to be joined, as a matter of course, to the wardenship of the Hospital above spoken of. When he left the hospital from which he had been so ruthlessly driven, and settled himself down in his own modest manner in the High Street of Barchester, he had not expected that others would make more fuss about it than he was inclined to do himself; and the extent of his hope was, that the movement might have been made in time to prevent any further paragraphs in the Jupiter. His affairs, however, were not allowed to subside thus quietly, and people were quite as much inclined to talk about the disinterested sacrifice he had made, as they had before been to upbraid him for his cupidity. The most remarkable thing that occurred, was the receipt of an autograph letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury, in which the primate very warmly praised his conduct, and begged to know what his intentions were for the future.",svenja,,

If I was not unmoved by the suddenness of this introduction — appealing as it did, to me at least, to old memories — the Countess was composure itself: a faint smile in acknowledgment of the speech, a gentle expression of easy satisfaction on meeting one who had visited her country, were all that even my prying curiosity could detect.

Nor can this this reluctance be stigmatized as the effect of little-minded pride, since every person of the least experience or. the least intel- ligence, may perpetually observethat meil will expect, will even claim as a privilege annexed to the title of protector, bene- factor, or patron, the right of dictating the conduct, the opinions, and sentiments of their fellow- beings, whose judgment may probably be much superior to their own; and this merely because chance or local situation may have given them the power, and vanity the inclination, to promote some concern of interest or some effort of industry. Whether this emotion ofRosaura's mind were censurable or otherwise however, it was not dissipated as she proceeded in the career of solicitation marked out by Countess Almerini : slie imagined, and with great reason, that many an eye which was wont to court her notice, was now turned upon her with airs of conde- scension and superiority, that would merely have Iiave excited a smile, had her mind been at ease, or could she even have dismissed from it the idea that she was entreating the intervention ofpovver to stay the course of justice. Her conscience perpetually instigated to lier, that to deprive a fellow- creature of life in the fuiy of vengeance, or the rashness of passion, was dreadful; nor could the plea so often advanced, that the life cf the successful combatant had been equally exposed, extenuate in her heart the horror of the homicide — since homicide it is called. Depresserl by tliese ideas, she appeared cold and abstracted where an abler peti- tioner would liave employed the v/armth and energy of pathetic declamation ; and where the affected vivacity of assuied success would have favourably decided the irresolution of tho^e who always incline to a minority of oj^inions, Rosaura be- trayed a weariness, a sinking of the soul, wliich was construed into the listlessness of despair.

714,"The princijjal artiste should be able to perform the most intricate and difficult steps with joerfect ease as if they came to her without an effort, so that the spectators may never become conscious of the pain and anxiety she very likely endures while going through her performance. Moreover, a great danseuse must be possessed of a very mobik' face ; for in a form of art in which words are interdicted all emotions have to be expressed by the movements of the face and the body, and they must be so marked that the public may grasp the situation at a glance. Pantomime is one of the most im])ortant parts of a ballet-girl's education ; dei)ort- ment is almost as essential. But the girl who aspires to become a really great danseuse must not only be consummate in all the technique of the art, but she must also be born with the instincts of a tragic actress, for to stir the emotions of the s])ectators, as Taglioni is said to have done, when you are unable to open your mouth, requires as much genius as to act the parts of Oi)holia or Lady Macbeth. The ballet, as I conceive it, should be a picture of all that is most beautiful and refined ; it should be in turns soothing, elevating, and inspiriting ; it should for a moment raise the spectators from the world of vulgar realities into a world of fantasy ; it should give you a vision of dreamland — it should be a poem.""

There he sat in a stall in the front row, and when Corinna came forward to sing her song, there were but few who followed the young lady's performance, most of those present eagerly watching his enthusiastic face.

I can read in your face, Florence, that still your sympathies go with your section ; you feel still as a Louisianian, and you will not blame me if it should be my fate to fight for the laws that have done you such bitter wrong. Well ; but this is the point, this is the way in which this excitement bears on you?
