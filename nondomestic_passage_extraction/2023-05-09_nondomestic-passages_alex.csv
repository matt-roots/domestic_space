752,"""Yes, of course. First of all — ah, I cannot go on in this way, cataloguing things,"" exclaimed Eleanor passionately. "" It is too horrible. I don't believe I have the right to ask one of these questions ; and yet I feel as if so much depended on my knowing the answers to them ! "" She had sat up, and leaned forward, looking with intense earnestness, pleading earnestness at him. Michael, imperceptibly to her, caught his breath. The temptation was strong to bid her ask what she would, since he knew her motives must be pure.",alex,,
757,"I believe he promised him over and over again — seeing that he was a boy of talents above the common order — that he would place him in some occupation either be- longing to the law, the church, or medicine, that would give scope for the employment of his faculties — if he would but apply and render himself fit for it. But you know nothing would induce Paul to set seriously to work — to labour — drudge, if you will, as people must labour who hope to succeed. Nothing could persuade him to cross his inclination for wasting his time in vain, aimless wanderings, whether of mind or body."" A pause of a few seconds, but the husband made no answer. Kate went on. "" He was unfit for any profession. Not pious enough for the church, not industrious enough for the law, still less calculated for medicine.",alex,,
762,"The little man starts from his chair ; another instant, and he has passed the screen ; his arm is around his daughter. "" Georgina,"" he says in accents hoarse with sorrow, "" you have grieved me once to-night, inadvertently I know, but cruelly. Will you, my child, yet grieve me further ? Unintentionally I have overheard a part of your discourse. I bid you, if you love me, I bid you forgive the Captain. He has been over hasty, but — "" "" Oh, papa,"" cries the girl, resting her head on her father's bosom, "" you do not know all he has said."" "" Forgive him, Georgie. He thought that you sinned knowingly."" ""And if I do forgive him I shall be wretched, when every one supposes I am an impudent creature.",alex,,
767,"""Julia!"" he said, at length, ""I firmly be- lieved that I could never hope again ; for more than four years I have believed the letter you wrote to me from Eagle's Cliff had sealed my fate for ever ; and what leads me to think otherwise at this moment ? Who shall say ? 1 cannot. I cannot even guess why it is that, in defiance of that letter, in defiance of your own assurance, so calmly, so deliberately given, I should be mad enough to risk the agony of another refusal. But were I to ask the same question of you that I presume that unhappy young man to have asked — if once more I were to ask you to be my wife, would you repeat your tremendous 1 Never ! never ?'

I. p ture, and then had turned to the ' Butter- cups,' and began painting a hazy land- scape background taken from a sketch which Coleman had lent him. The ances- tress, in her blue gown and gold-spotted gauze scarf, had been turned face to the wall, and Nellie Crane stood unfinished on the easel, when Felix heard a knock on the door. He shouted ' Come in !' but as no one entered, he sauntered across to interview the visitor. It was Lord Lillebonne. ' Oh, I beg your pardon, my lord !' cried Vereker ; ' I thought it would only be one of my set, some art-student.",alex,,
777,"Verily God hath manifested Himself unto us, and given comfort for the sorrow of the world ! ' She seemed yet entranced, — her eyes were luminous, her face glowingly beautiful as that of some inspired angel. Barabbas grew more and more impatient. ' Woman, thou art dazed or in a vision ! ' he exclaimed — ' Thy Master was ever a worker of miracles, and surely He hath worked them in the night that now is past! Prate not thus of His rising from the dead, — for of a truth methinks thou knowest that He hath never died !

782,"She had insensibly habituated herself to regard him as the type of all that was best and noblest in human nature. His own hand had torn the veil aside. He himself had taught her the first bitter lesson of man's deceit and woman's credulity — of blighted hopes and betrayed affection; still the convic- tion of his unworthiness was fraught with far too much of misery and regret to be admitted without a struggle more severe than any which Emily had ever yet been called on to encounter. On the other hand, her position with re- gard to Lord Errington was scarcely less painful or perplexing. His very devotion, his generous disinterestedness, his un- bounded confidence, became only so many additional sources of shame and self-reproach. In the intimate intercourse which now sub- sisted between them (for his chief delight appeared to be in eliciting her sentiments on every subject, and in laying bare his whole heart before her in return), she had learned to estimate his noble character as it deserved, and painful indeed was the comparison which forced itself on her recol- lection between his highmindedness, his noble candour, his generous, self-denying affection, and that of one whom she had loved — "" not wisely, but too well."" She had learned, too, how rigid were his opinions on many subjects, how pure his sentiments on all ; and the knowledge, while it enhanced her sense of his superiority, brought with it, at the same time, a feeling of dread and self-accusation, and yet an increased desire for his good opinion, which was painfully at variance with the consciousness of decep- tion that made her feel ever a guilty thing when in his presence.

787,"How can you support yourself V asked Dick. * Where would your supplies come from V ' I should leave the country, or enlist.' ' Not a cheerful programme ! You would soon be wishing you were back with me again, with plenty of money in your pockets, and little to do but spend it.' ' I think not,' said Charles, still speaking in the calmest tones. ' You had better let me go. I cannot work with you as another man could.' '",alex,,
792,"Emma would have gone with her, but Anne entreated to be left alone, observ^- ing, she could not talk, and wished to say it is one — but — my mother, I will tell thee all, and learn from thy lips how far I have strayed from the right path."" For the first night in her life anxiety banished sleep from the innocent Anne. She arose in the morning but little re- freshed, and at an early hour sought her mother ; but that kind parent still suf- fered from the headache that had ba- nished her from the family circle the preceding evening, and could not bear even the soft voice of her darling child. Neither the words nor manner of Anne Hammond on this evening escaped the observation of the eagerly watchful Lord Dun more, who waited some proof of reciprocal attachment before he ven- tured to declare sentiments, which he knew would create some commotion in the good friend's family. "" This proof,'* said he to himself, ** I have now happily received, and doubt and uncertainty shall not, dearest Anne, be added to your newly-awakened feelings, nor longer afflict and torment my peace. I will candidly open my heart to father and daughter immediately.""",alex,,
797,"I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of my own species; it appeared that he would not understand, though I spoke to him; so, I stood off, and held my tongue, in great perplexity. A movement of Catherine's relieved me a little presently: she put up her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his, as he held her: while he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly— “You teach me now how cruel you've been —cruel and false. Why did you despise me? Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one word of comfort—you deserve this. You have killed yourself.",alex,,
802,"Maize is a colour that decidedly did not suit his complexion, and it is one that soon soils; why, then, did Mr Barton select it for domestic wear? Perhaps because he had a knack of hitting on the wrong thing in garb as well as in grammar. Mrs Barton now lighted her candle, and seated herself before her heap of stockings. She had something disagreeable to tell her husband, but she would not enter on it at once. “Have you had a nice evening, dear?” “Yes, pretty well. Ely was there to dinner, but went away rather early.",alex,,
807,"""In that man behold the ruler of England, Scotland, and Ireland,"" answered the Spirit; "" yet think not unjustly of him, nor mis- deem him, as some will, a spirit of selfishness and guile. He will war in the cause of freedom, and wisely and w^ell, but war too long ; for when liberty is won, and tjTanny humbled, he will keep the sword unsheathed, and crush the crown, confound the church, and silence the haughty tongue of the arrogant nobility. England will ov/e him much, and fame owe him all the applause which can be given to a warm lover of his country, a successful assertor of her glory, and a wise and conscientious judge and chief ruler.""

812,"find out why Lyla has not returned."" The Asiatic assented mutely ; and so soon as he had departed, Eustace crawled to the door of the tent, with his glass, to watch for Lyla, whom he hoped to see accompany her mother in the descent from her mountain lair. He saw the stream dasliing and sparkling down from its coronet of dark pines, throwing a veil of white mist over the rocky gromid, but all beside seemed silent and motionless on the neighbouring mountain. He could not even see the ac- customed fioTire of the herds-woman leavino^ the herd with her skin of milk. Tlie position in which he had placed him- self made his wounded leg more painful by standing on it, and he limped back to his bed. He had no remedy but patience, and in that quality Eustace was not abundant. Few youths of twenty have much of a virtue which, as Fielding sagely observes, is "" apt to be worn out with over-exertion,"" though, m other respects, he was in character more like a man of thkty — circumstances, and the necessity for decision on what course to pursue, and subsequent action on the deter- mination, having made a natm^ally manly character even more masculine.",alex,,

But what the new speaker, a woman, thought too bad, was not destined to be expressed at this moment ; for, Signer Pachetti hastily dragging his most unwiHing companion into some room behind, their words were quite in- audible. In a few minutes they reappeared. Signor Pachetti introduced the female as his wife, who desired the Donna to walk in — in a tone which sounded as if she had said, walk out. The evening had now closed in, and a little earthenware lamp dimly lighted a small close room, where a table was laid, apparently for supper.",alex,,

'' My father has sworn to cut me off with a shilling ; and though I would gladly obtain his forgive- ness, I covet none of his property.

872,"Con- sequently, when, the morning after Miles's fiasco at Hardrio;o;s, Dr. Bede was summoned to come to Lord Sandilands at once, physician and pa- tient knew as much about each other as, failing a personal inten'iew, was possible. Symptoms detailed, examination made, Dr. Bede — a very precise and methodical little gen- tleman, wdth a singularly neatly-tied black neck- erchief, towards wdiich the eye of every patient was infallibly attracted, and a curiously stony and expressionless blue eye of his own, out of which nothing could ever be gleaned, — Dr. Bede, tightly buttoned to the throat in his little black surtout, gives it as his decided opinion that it is sout, ^' and not a doubt about it."" Lord Sandi- lands, really half-gratified that he is literally laid by the heels by an aristocratic and gentlemanly complaint, combats the notion — no hereditary pre- disposition, no previous symptoms. Dr. Bede is firm and Lord Sandilands is convinced. An af- fair of time, of com'se; an affair very much at the patient's own will; entire abstinence from this and that and the other, and very little of anything else; perfect quiet and rest of mind and body — of mind quite as much as body — re- peats the little doctor, with a would-be sharp glance at the patient, whose mental worry shows itself in a thousand little ways, all of which are patent to the sharp-eyed practitioner. Lord San- dilands promises obedience with a half laugh; he is very much obliged to Dr. Bede, he has thorough confidence in his comprehension and treatment of the case; there is no need to send to town for Dumfimk? Dr. Bede, wltli confi- dence daslied witli humility, tliinks not — of course it is for liis lordship to decide ; but he, Dr. Bede, has not the smallest fear, provided his instruc- tions are strictly obeyed; and he is quite aware of the value of the charge Sir Charles Dum- funk has confided to him.",alex,,

897,"It was no fault of his, that every- thing was made easy to hirn, untU he never felt hirnself at ease. It was no fault of his, that his selfishness was ministered unto, until he lost all pleasure in himself. The three things he most wanted were, a little spare diet, exercise, and wholesome discipline. Had Horace Grant known these in early life, he might have been a noble and a happy man ; for, even as it was, there were dawnings of a better nature about hirn, and heart-warm smUes that sometimes dimpled over his face, and bright beaming looks so füll of intelligence and truth, that the mother who ruined such a boy ought to have taken shame to her- self for her miscalculating indulgence. If, however, the countenance of the boy was capable of being thus enUvened, it was equally capable of a shade too dark for expression — a something like absolute blackness, which came over it for a moment, making hirn almost terrific in his power to resist or to revenge; and Lucy always quailed before this look in her brother, and crept away from hirn, as if at such times his good angel had deserted hirn and her. It was not passion which caUed forth this expression of countenance in the boy, for he had scarcely sufficient energy to be called passionate.",alex,,

932,"Before she was aware of his affection, she had looked forward to his recovery with mingled emotions.

The ship was lost on her passage, and the ill-fated Maria and her lovely offspring were buried in the piti- less waves. To attempt a description of his feelings, who was thus destined to survive the wreck of every thing dear to him on earth, would be as painful as it is impossible ; yet he did survive it, and a temporary deprivation of reason ren- dered him for some time insensible to his sufferings.

Finding, however, that a commanding officer, without men to command, was neither useful nor ornamental, he applied personally to the Adjutant-general, for advice under the circumstances, observing, that he wished to be appointed to some other duty. The Adjutant-general, at the moment the appli- cation was made to him, happened to be proceed- ing across the village in which they were quar- tered, to Lord Wellington ; and said he would speak to his Lordship, requesting Thompson to call on him, for the purpose of knowing the Com- mander of the forces' will on the subject.

UNFORESEEN PERIL IT falls to the lot of doctors and parsons to see many strange things, and they are, or ought to be, much less easily astonished than the rest of us. Anglican clerics, it is true, learn remarkably little, as a rule, considering what their oppor- tunities are, because they lack that preliminary training which is of so much value to their brethren of the Romish communion ; but the average Enghsh doctor knows a good deal, and may be relied upon to exercise the average English common sense in dealing with the facts before him. Matthew Austin, therefore, ascribed no more importance than it deserved to an episode which might have had uncomfortable results for Miss Frere, if not for himself, nor did he think it incumbent upon him to go out of his way in order to call at Hayes Park and ascertain what he had omitted to ask on the occasion of their last meeting, whether she had effected her midnight entry without detection. Hearing nothing in the course of the next few days, he assumed — and was quite correct in assuming — that she and the nurse had managed matters successfully between them. For the rest, he was a little disinclined to seek further occasions of private parley with Anne, fearing lest she might insist upon hearing more about her brother than it was desirable that she 103 should hear.

Wonder- "" Wonderful and magnanimous,"" re- peated Lady Caroline, who, weary of playing off a puppet that was too uni- form to shew her own address, lolled listlessly on the sopha, while Melifan- driania performed her tour of graces. "" I protest, Lady Fitzjohn,"" continued she, "" if had such a daughter I should be wretched."" The fond mother started, and uttered an exclamatory "" Madam !"" at this ob- servation. """,alex,,
1177,"I. P "" I have not time to argue the question with you now,"" he replied, impatiently. "" I am sorry you should have come so far on such a fruitless errand ; but you must just make the best you can of your trouble, for, God knows, I have enough to do with my own ! I have an important engagement."" As he spoke he went towards the door, and waited till she should retire. Stunned by the sudden cruelty of his words and manner, the girl passed him without reply, and went out into the twilight, not know- ing whither she went.",alex,,
1182,"After a few questions, to which she had no difficulty in replying, he inquired with an indifferent air — like one who expects an answer in the nega- tive — whether she had noticed any signs of trouble or anxiety about her husband of late. Here she hesitated, in view of possible contingencies. Would it. be better to answer 'Yes,' or ' No ' ? If ' Yes,' that would lead to fresh inquiries as to the nature of his trouble; if 'No,' that would militate against the theory of his having become deranged. ' Have you any cause, for instance, to suppose Mr. Milbank to have been in pecuniary difficulties ? ' continued the inspector, proceeding with his inter- rogatory.",alex,,
1187,"Q That there were ladies living at his ex- pense in most of the capitals of Europe ; that his doings when on a tour in India were too awful for Christians to name ; that he had already had two attacks of delirium tremens ; that he employed his wealth for the basest uses; that he had murdered a husband in Italy; that he had caused the suicide of a girl in France — such things as these were said of him as a matter of course ; and scarcely a week passed without one of those newspapers which our civilization has produced, for the purpose of ministering to the desire of ladies and gentlemen to be notorious, publishing a thinly- veiled allusion to him, with some new scandal evolved from the editor's inner consciousness, but amusing enough all the same. At first Quorn, surprised and taken aback at the disagreeable fame thus thrust upon him, protested that, if he had his faults, he was not worse than others of his kind and class. No. Society had made up its mind to have a magnificent monster, and who would act the part better than this good- looking young man, with his contempt for les convenances and his unlimited purse and grand position ? Then he became disgusted, and ended by surrounding himself with a little court of adroit, if somewhat vulgar, parasites, who kept the outer world from his majesty, and amid whose endless chorus of praise he was content to live — like the fabled beast who puts his head in the sand to escape detec- tion. He gave himself up — or seemed to give himself up — to purely animal pleasures.",alex,,
1192,"At least she had succeeded in concealing this from him, and now they would probably never meet again. With these ideas floating in her brain she fell asleep, having given all requisite orders for their early start the following morning. The journey was tedious, for the country was somewhat uninteresting ; and Mona, being a stranger in that part of the land, could not supply information as she had done during the previous day. Uncle Sandy bemoaned the heat, the cost, the weariness of travel ; and his niece was truly glad when they reached a shabby little station in a rather flat but prettily-wooded country, and everyone got out. A brisk struggle for the passengers oc- curred between the conducteurs of the various omnibuses, char a bancs, etc., which awaited the arrival of the train ; and out- side the station yard was a gathering of the peasant inhabitants of the village — the men in blouses, the women in nice white caps and aprons — staring at the strangers deposited at their gates, loudly discussing their appearance in shrill voices and with many gestures. 1 It ought to be a wonderfu' cure to come this weary long road for it ! ' groaned Uncle Sandy, as he descended from their convey- ance when it stopped before the entrance of the' etablissement.",alex,,
1197,"I cannot say,"" said Fitzallan, with a smile, "" that our conversation embraced any of those topics."" "" May I ask then,"" said Mr. Bode, what parti- cular topics it did embrace ?"" "" If I must be candid,"" answered Fitzallan, "" I will confess that the subject of love chiefly engrossed our conversation."" "" And did you confine the subject to conversation only?'' asked Mr. Bode, in a most significant tone; "" were none of the senses called in to assist in the elu- cidation? was no passion worked up to an almost insufferable intensity, to demonstrate practically the truth of your assertions ? was not all that a woman's power contains employed to show that, notwithstand- ing all your vaunted strength and greatness, you are but the weaker subject of the two? All for love, is the female maxim, and the senses have always a majority in the choice of a lover. And what has been the result of all this?",alex,,
1202,"Many of those who stand here this night may not live to see a bill passed which will enable catholics to sit amongst them. But such a bill will be carried ! In that day we shall forget past disappointments, or remember them only to triumph. In that day we shall forget (and his eye turned suddenly towards Lionel,) the long disheartening evenings, when we heard those whose age would rather have excused even a misplaced enthusiasm, raise their un- tried voices in their country's senate, to swell the cry of injustice and oppression."" The evening's debate closed ; and the bill was lost by one of those small majorities which, while they prove how little was wanting to turn the scale, yet make defeat more galling. *' Well, we're beat,"" said Clavering, in a vexed tone, as he passed Lionel in the lobby. *'",alex,,
1207,""" said Hannah, putting her white hand above her head to touch his that caressed her brown hair all the time he was speaking. ""It's true, Hannah, my lassie; and though I concluded not to return in * The Hope' and not to go back to Perth, which was my intention after I'd made Yarmouth — for there was a fellow there that sailed 'twixt that and Glasgae — I'd nae mair courage to speak to ye than if ye'd been just an angel frae Heaven !

1212,"“I am surprised none of your Scotch sçavans got hold of the fellow, and squeezed the secret out of him. It might have proved an important discovery— a very important discovery;—and your Scotch are not apt to let any thing escape them—a very searching shrewd people as ever I knew—and that's the only way to arrive at knowledge. A man must be of a stirring mind, if he expects to do good.” “A poor woman below wishes to see you, Sir,” said a servant. “These poor women are perfect pests to society,” said the Doctor, as his nose assumed a still darker hue; “there is no resting upon one's seat for them—always something the matter! They burn, and bruise, and hack themselves, and their brats, one would really think, on purpose to give trouble.” “I have not the least doubt of it,” said Lady Emily; “they must find your sympathy so soothing.”",alex,,
1217,"How far from the shore they were he could not judge ; he guessed they were steering for the castle of Vigilio. The boat was a large and steady one, but the men, whether to frighten the bravos, or too confi- dent of their seamanship, kept up the sail ; but the Marchese plainly saw that they carried too much canvas, for the waters of the lake were greatly agitated. '*' If you don't take that cursed sail of yours down,"" shouted Beppo, "" by St. Nicholas I'll blow your brains out. Didn't you see we were nearly upset by that last squall ?"" "" Your powder is damp, amico,"" laughed the man at the helm. "" Why we are not five hundred yards from the Quay of Vigilio, so sit still, for if you move about in that way, with that big carcase of yours, you'll upset the boat yourself.""",alex,,

1232,"""Well, now, Catherine,"" said he, addressing his daughter, who sat near him, ""upon my honor and conscience that was a friendly paragraph of my friend Swiggerly--extremely so, indeed. The fact is, a dinner and a good jorum is never thrown away upon honest Swiggerly; for which raison I'll ask him to dine here on Thursday next."" He then handed her the paper, pointing out the paragraph in question, which she read with something of an arch smile, and which, on her brother Fergus (who had been to Lisnagola) joining them, she handed to him. ""Fergus,"" said she, looking at him with an expression of character still more comic, but yet sufficiently subdued to prevent O'Driscol from observing it, ""is not that paragraph very complimentary to papa?"" Fergus, who at once reciprocated the comic glance alluded to, replied rather significantly, ""It is certainly very gratifying to him, Catherine."" ""And very creditable to Swiggerly,"" added O'Driscol. ""Yes, father,"" replied Fergus, ""but I think he ought to preserve, if possible, a little more originality.",alex,,
