751,"Some weighty matter was evidently before his mind. Suddenly he seemed to see light. With an air of great good fellowship, he exclaimed, — ' As sure as my name is Mr Mungo Mauch- line, and if I am anny joodge of the weather, .this is a shuperfine day.' There was really nothing special about the day; but Mr Mungo Mauchline objected to undue familiarity ; and this was his way of making known how he chose to be called. 'It's a geyan coorse day,' returned Mrs Gillespie, in an injured tone ; thinking of the effects of that draught upon her ' hoast.' ' Yes, there is a wind into it, I own,' granted Mr Mungo Mauchline, as if the day were his, and he responsible for the quality of it ; ' there is a little wind into it too — nut a rantin', tantin', tearin' wind ; but a nookin', soughin', wurnin' wind, as the minister in the story says.' ' Jist a wheen claivers, a' thae stories aboot ministers,' cried Mrs Gillespie tartly ; ' min- isters is nane dafter nor ither folk, an' no sae daft as some, Mungo.' '",mark,,
752,"""Yes, of course. First of all — ah, I cannot go on in this way, cataloguing things,"" exclaimed Eleanor passionately. "" It is too horrible. I don't believe I have the right to ask one of these questions ; and yet I feel as if so much depended on my knowing the answers to them ! "" She had sat up, and leaned forward, looking with intense earnestness, pleading earnestness at him. Michael, imperceptibly to her, caught his breath. The temptation was strong to bid her ask what she would, since he knew her motives must be pure.",alex,,
753,"The mountains of the Ngome, and over- looking the forest of that name, are flat- topped, like all others in South Africa ; but Major Marter found the western slope to be dangerously precipitous, and thence he and his guides looked down into a densely wooded valley, lying more than two thousand feet below. About two miles distant, thin smoke could be seen ascending amid the greenery, from a small kraal by the side of a brawling stream, and therein Cetewayo was known to be. As cavalry could not reach the bottom without making a very long detour, the Major ordered all the mounted men to lay aside their bright steel scabbards, and all Other accoutrements likely to create a rattling noise, and these, with the pack horses, were left in charge of a small party, the command of which was offered to the sinking Florian, who foolishly declined, and rode with the rest to a less precipitous slope of the hills three miles distant, down which the Dragoon Guards led their chargers by the bridle, crossed the stream referred to, a small fence, and a marsh, and, remounting, made a dash for the kraal, sword in hand, from the north, while the Native Contingent formed up south of it on some open ground. The capture of Cetewayo is an event too recent to be detailed at length here. It is known how his few followers, on seeing the red-coated cavalry riding up, shouted, in unison with the Native Contingent: * The white men are here — you are taken !' Then the fallen royal savage came forth, looking weary, weak, and footsore ; and when a soldier — Tom Tyrrell — attempted to seize him, he drew himself up with an air of simple dignity, and repelled him.",jessica,,

"" I have an excellent offer for my lodgings, which at present are empty, but I know not what to do with a poor woinan who has been with nie for some time, sincc the new-comers will want every room I can spare from my own family, and she is in a very bad state of health.

756,"But my monkey was up, and I was determined to see what it was, so I lit a candle and went back. Then, by groping about, I discovered that secret passage leading through into the other side ; and, never hesitating, I explored it at once, and the next minute found myself in the opposite bed-room ; but, raising my candle a little, I saw a female in bed, and so hooked it out again sharp; though I must tell you that, just as I got through into her room, I twigged the door at the further side closing on somebody in the act of going out.""

757,"I believe he promised him over and over again — seeing that he was a boy of talents above the common order — that he would place him in some occupation either be- longing to the law, the church, or medicine, that would give scope for the employment of his faculties — if he would but apply and render himself fit for it. But you know nothing would induce Paul to set seriously to work — to labour — drudge, if you will, as people must labour who hope to succeed. Nothing could persuade him to cross his inclination for wasting his time in vain, aimless wanderings, whether of mind or body."" A pause of a few seconds, but the husband made no answer. Kate went on. "" He was unfit for any profession. Not pious enough for the church, not industrious enough for the law, still less calculated for medicine.",alex,,
758,"An hour^ nor yet a couple was sufficient to talk over the one half we had to say ; so we willingly accepted an invitation to dinner, I having already declared my intention of walk- ing to Mansfield Lodge, which was not less than three miles off. Dr. Tomkins, I have little doubt, fathomed my melancholy motives for this stroll ; for I perceived him cast a signi- ficant glance towards his sister, which was returned by one equally expressive of concern on her part, though not a single observation escaped them. As for myself I knew per- fectly what was passing in their minds, (for they knew of my unfortunate amour, although mistaken as to the object,) and my confusion must have been sufficiently obvious to them as quitting the Parsonage, we directed our steps towards a place which abounded with as many melancholy remembrances as my own family mansion. After following the high road for upwards of a mile, I struck into a by path, that in- tersected that lane about the very spot, where I first met with Mansfield and his daughters, when he himself was so brutally assaulted by his Irish steward. The nearer I drew to this well remembered place, the more overpowering became my feehngs ; and Foster who well knew the cause, had the kind dehcacy to Unger pur- posely behind, so as to keep me within sight without intruding upon my sorrows. At length I came to the old twisted iron gate of the avenue, the lower portion of which was matted with weeds and briars ; and alas !",jessica,,

763,"Several months past he had applied for permission to be admitted a student at the senior department of that establishment ; but other, and much more engrossing events having intervened, the college had completely vanished from his thoughts, and the pre- paration necessary for his entrance exami- nation. The month of January had already com- menced, and the cornet was summoned to appear at Sandhurst on the first of the ensuing February. Not a single book, connected with the college course, had been looked into by him— even his school arithmetic had not been refreshed — decimals, fractions, and proportion, he recollected but the names of. The cornet numbered the few days that were allowed him for preparation, and trembled. "" Every candidate,"" say the regulations for the students of the senior department of the Royal Military College, "" will have to undergo an examination previous to admission. The examination will be chiefly in the elements of geometry ; but if deemed necessary, it will be extended to other elementary puts of education requisite to qualify ham for making progress in the branches of instruction taught at the col- lege."" Pierce looked out in his pocket Johnson for the word "" geometry,"" and found that it was a noun substantive, signifying "" the science of quantity, extension, or magnitude, abstractedly considered.""",jessica,,
764,"The eastern side, which is peculiarly rough and rugged, was formerly the chief seat of Macgregor and his clan. Occu- pying a district almost inaccessible, when roads were unknown and the country more wooded, the Macgregors were enabled to carry on a cruel as well as a predatory system of warfare on the surrounding clans; forcing contribu- tions under the title of "" black mail/""' But it would be vain to attempt to describe scenes, fitted only for the one pen, or the artist's pencil, and which can hardly bear to be tamed into description. The wanderers scarcely spoke to each other, so charmed were they by the air of stillness and solemnity around them : their dreamy as- sociations were not materialised by any thoughts of busy every-day life ; they felt the poetry, which external nature in the hour of twilight majestically creates! "" I love thee, twilight! as thy shadows roll, The calm of evening steals upon the soul ; Sublimely tender, solemnly serene, Still as the hour, enchanting as the scene ! Twilight I love thee, — let thy glooms increase Till every feeling, — every pulse — is peace!""

He can paint beautifully; and it was only the other evening, at the rector}^, that Mr. Nelson said artists were just as well off as any other professional men, and as well thought of If he likes painting better than anything else, and sees his way to get on, why should he not be an artist ?"" "" Nonsense, child,"" was her mother's answer to Grace's special pleading.

773,"""We aren't so ambitious as you seem to think ; but we do what little we can."" Lord Walter had at one time examined into the social problems arising out of excess of population, over-crowding, com- petition, drunkenness and the like, and had read a great many Blue Books bearing upon these subjects. The conclusion at which he had arrived was a disheartening one, and it made him impatient of the futile panaceas of well-meaning persons. Nevertheless, he admired Miss Shafto for engaging in a kindly work — or else he admired the work because Miss Shafto was engaged in it. Possibly, if she had been a sour- faced old maid, with a pair of spec- tacles and a dowdy gown, he would have changed the subject ; but as it was, a five- pound note was withdrawn from his pocket and placed in the young lady's white palm. ""I'll do likewise,"" said he; ''I'll do what little I can."" Whereupon Miss Shafto pointed out to him that, although five-pound notes were all very well and they were much indebted to him for his generosity, that was not quite all that he could do towards helping his less fortunate fellow-creatures.

775,"The regular breathing of the sleeper, the ticking of a gold hunting-watch suspended at the head of the bed, and the crackling of the burning logs, were the only sounds that broke the stillness. "" I have no doubt you have been anxious, Lady Audley,-*^ Robert said, after a pause, fixing my lady's eyes as they wandered furtively to his face. '^ There is no one to whom my uncle's life can be of more value than to you. Your happiness, your prosperity, your safety depend alike upon his existence.''

779,"I no sooner found myself alone, than all I the horrors returned upon me, which are to a certain degree almost always suspend- iiv ed, when man stands in the presence of his fellow-c feature. I traversed the walk in which Penruddock had left me with a rapid pace ; I beat myself with my clenched fist upon my forehead. It was no doubt early ^ays, for me to break off all commerce with my kind, and to shut myself out from human life. But so I was constituted ; such was the effect that this incident pro* duced upon me. I felt that the d©or of manly existence had just been opened up- on me, that I had been permitted for a mo- ment to contemplate prospects that appear- ed to me delicious and rapturous (for what sensation exists more rapturous, than that which a young man experiences, when he feels for the first time, that he is counted for something substantive in the dramatis persoYKje of society, that his voice is number. ed, that his opinion is listened to, that some eyes are turned upon him to remark the part he shall act ?) — and that then the door was suddenly and violently clapped in my face* I was left alone, in the narrow line between being and no-being ; the impene- trable door of exclusion, framed of the most hardened and the thickest oak, clamped with iron, and thick studded with the larg- est nails, before me, and the precipice of annihilation behind me.

780,"There was something, I say, pleasing in the countenance of the young man : his form was fine and athletic ; his manner of address gentle and agreeable; and so expressive was the eye that remained, that if he had had its fellow, I question whether jealousy might have permitted me to make the proposal which is contained in the next sentence. "" Harkee, young- man,"" said I, "" you seem willing to work for your wages, — 't is perhaps the same thing to you whether you work at sea or on land, or in one town or another : if you 're agreed to step on board with me, you shall have two double doubloons, and fare well, till I put you ashore at Alicante."" "" At Alicante ! "" repeated the young man in an agitated voice, the reason of which will become known by and by — "" to Alicante be it then, and God bless you for the offer;"" and thus I was provided with a servant. I must confess, that curiosity to know how the loss of an eye could be the ruin of a man, was as powerful a motive with me to engage his services, as either com- passion for his condition, or my own necessities. Before doubling Cape tie Gata, I had found some occasion for the services of an attendant, who, as it will afterwards be seen, had too much experience of the sea, to be incommoded by the white swell against which we were forced to beat all the way from Malaga; but having once rounded this cape, we ran directly for Cartha- gena, in which port we cast anchor on the fourth day. Here, although our stay was short, I did not forget the new character under which I travelled ; and in that character, contrived to get quit of some few of my pieces. I was equally charmed with the Carthagena women, and the Balsapintada wine ; weakness being the characteristic of the one, and strength of the other.",matt,,
781,"Julia was not at all immoderate, for she had been schooled, in the matter of love, in the most rigid principles of courtship, and had learnt to restrain her own feelings, and not to be at all surprised or disappointed in the corres- ponding self-restraint on the part of her lover. Morey very soon brought about a revolution in Julia's maidenly consciousness and expect- ations, and he was delighted to find that she quite enjoyed the change, and would respond to him as demonstratively as he could reason- ably expect. Morey was all that her heart could desire, and she was not ashamed now to confess that she loved him very dearly, and would have him whether her uncle approved of it or not. He might disown her and leave her penniless, if he could be so prejudiced and cruel, but have Morey she would ; no sacrifice was now too great to make for love like his. Morey Maguire always had abundance of spirits, and could always make himself agree- able, especially in the society of ladies. His humour was never of that flimsy kind which indicates the consciousness that ladies are always to be entertained by something light and frivolous. He never condescended to this, for he held woman in very profound respect, and with some differences in his feelings, which no woman can reasonably find fault with or resent — for they were purely feelings of greater tenderness and courtesy, — he always treated them as possess- ing equal intelligence with himself, and as participating in the same lively interests of which he himself was conscious.",mark,,
782,"She had insensibly habituated herself to regard him as the type of all that was best and noblest in human nature. His own hand had torn the veil aside. He himself had taught her the first bitter lesson of man's deceit and woman's credulity — of blighted hopes and betrayed affection; still the convic- tion of his unworthiness was fraught with far too much of misery and regret to be admitted without a struggle more severe than any which Emily had ever yet been called on to encounter. On the other hand, her position with re- gard to Lord Errington was scarcely less painful or perplexing. His very devotion, his generous disinterestedness, his un- bounded confidence, became only so many additional sources of shame and self-reproach. In the intimate intercourse which now sub- sisted between them (for his chief delight appeared to be in eliciting her sentiments on every subject, and in laying bare his whole heart before her in return), she had learned to estimate his noble character as it deserved, and painful indeed was the comparison which forced itself on her recol- lection between his highmindedness, his noble candour, his generous, self-denying affection, and that of one whom she had loved — "" not wisely, but too well."" She had learned, too, how rigid were his opinions on many subjects, how pure his sentiments on all ; and the knowledge, while it enhanced her sense of his superiority, brought with it, at the same time, a feeling of dread and self-accusation, and yet an increased desire for his good opinion, which was painfully at variance with the consciousness of decep- tion that made her feel ever a guilty thing when in his presence.

Her prayers to the Almighty were frequent, in behalf of his soul, and that she might soon partake of the heavenly bliss with her deceased lord, there to be again united, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. At this period of her lamentations, the term of which precisely I am not acquainted with, but, as far as we can con- jecture, may have been some five or six years, the lady had not lost the freshness of her beauty, nor had the morning of her days entirely flitted away. Her countenance would sometimes beam forth rays of cheerfulness, even as Aurora gladdens the eastern sky on a fine summer's morning. The portals of her eyes, the lashes of which were the finest that mortals ever beheld, inspired emo- tion within the breast, especially when they flowed forth in tears like showers in an April day ; and her voice was so soft, that it was as the southern breezes wafting the perfumes of Am- brosia. Her breathing was, in her lover's ima- gination, as the zephyrs fanning the woodbine leaves, and in fragrance resembled the nectar's balmy juice, that the industrious bees oft mistook them for Flora's beauteous rose. Her hands were as lilies of the valley ; and, gentlemen of the jury, to finish all her perfections in one word, her bosom was as white as snow, at least in the imagi- nation of that youthful lover, who is now arraigned for assault and battery upon this same beautiful lady of his acquaintance, and for which he now stands to be heard in his defence at your bar.",svenja,,

Symptoms detailed, examination made, Dr. Bede — a very precise and methodical little gen- tleman, wdth a singularly neatly-tied black neck- erchief, towards wdiich the eye of every patient was infallibly attracted, and a curiously stony and expressionless blue eye of his own, out of which nothing could ever be gleaned, — Dr. Bede, tightly buttoned to the throat in his little black surtout, gives it as his decided opinion that it is sout, ^' and not a doubt about it."" Lord Sandi- lands, really half-gratified that he is literally laid by the heels by an aristocratic and gentlemanly complaint, combats the notion — no hereditary pre- disposition, no previous symptoms. Dr. Bede is firm and Lord Sandilands is convinced. An af- fair of time, of com'se; an affair very much at the patient's own will; entire abstinence from this and that and the other, and very little of anything else; perfect quiet and rest of mind and body — of mind quite as much as body — re- peats the little doctor, with a would-be sharp glance at the patient, whose mental worry shows itself in a thousand little ways, all of which are patent to the sharp-eyed practitioner. Lord San- dilands promises obedience with a half laugh; he is very much obliged to Dr. Bede, he has thorough confidence in his comprehension and treatment of the case; there is no need to send to town for Dumfimk? Dr. Bede, wltli confi- dence daslied witli humility, tliinks not — of course it is for liis lordship to decide ; but he, Dr. Bede, has not the smallest fear, provided his instruc- tions are strictly obeyed; and he is quite aware of the value of the charge Sir Charles Dum- funk has confided to him.",alex,,

This was a coarsely built man, with a face reddened, it might be, by constant exposure to sun and wind, and whose ear-rings were not seen to much advantage amid the mass of long, black hair that tangled around his head. The expression of his features Avas not exactly ferocious, but it was stern and forbidding, and a smile which disclosed an array of formidably strong wliite teeth did not extend itself to liis keen dark eyes. His hands were red and muscular, and a coloured shirt, secured at the throat by a ribbon and ring, was surmounted by no collar, and showed a powerful bull neck, one that might have belonged to a gladiator of the old days. The guest's figure was broad, and, as far as could be seen, for he did not rise from his lounging position on a low chair, he appeared to be under the middle height, a disad- vantage apparently more than compensated for in his large and powerful limbs. Coarsely, rather than carelessly dressed, it would have been hard to assign him a profession, though perhaps his general bearing, and some mystic signs that had been traced with gunpowder on the backs of his hands, might suggest the impression that he had some connection with sea-service.

Yet each countenance was mild and tranquil, and even kindly in its expression. And, strangely enough, it seemed to me that in this very calm and benignity consisted the secret of the dread which the countenances inspired. They seemed as void of the lines and shadows which care and sorrow, and passion and sin, leave upon the faces of men, as are the faces of sculptured gods, or as, in the eyes of Christian mourners, seem the peaceful brows of the dead.

Finding that Mac Skinner, sen. had been so successful in recovering the amount of the former wadset from Glenmore, several of the most vindic- tive of his creditors thought the letting loose of that personage upon his daughter, in the spring-tide of her sorrow, might be the means of squeezing all that was squeezable out of the estate. It may easily be con- ceived, that this scheme was very eagerly relished by the wily doer j and, in order to render the measures he might pursue more efficient, he pre- vailed upon all the creditors of the chief, of whom he could obtain know- ledge, to assign their bonds, bills, and obligations against the chief; in order that he, the holder, might sue for the joint behoof. The precarious condition of the Glenmore estate, and the inroads of wadsets and annual rents, induced the creditors to execute a most absolute assignation in favour of old Mac Skinner ; and no sooner was he armed with this deed, than he com- menced operations. The ultimate object of Mac Skinner, in taking this trouble, for the behoof of Glenmore's creditors, (for that was his ostensible object,) was one of very deep and crafty purpose : It was this : to possess himself, or rather his hope- ful heir, the partner of Mac Fleecer, of the estate and honours of Glenmore ; to procure for the said heir the hand of Flora, which was, indeed, a sine qua non in the business ; and then turning round upon the creditors, to whom he had taken care to give no back bond, to set them and their claims at defiance ; and thus raise his family to the first rank in the Highlands, without any other price than a reasonable portion of legal villainy.",matt,,
911,"I well remember my husband's look when I, being forbidden by my doctors to perform a mother's office by the little creature, composedly resigned it to the charge of another, and prepared to return with him to Lisbon. It was not disap- pointment, not anger, but a kind of quiet settled disapprobation, as if he had expected no better from me. I did not understand it at the time; I was solely occupied with my delight at the idea of being with him again after so long- a separation. Some little while afterwards I looked back upon it, and appreciated it. ^* We shall be a whole day's journey distant from the boj^, if he remains here,"" observed Mr. TyrreU. ^' True/' replied I, carelessly ; "" but Dr. Ulloa says that he has a feeble constitution, and that his best chance of health is to Hve in this air for the next few months.

912,"Lady Clarissa, whenever the governess seated herself at table, directed a searching look upon her costume ; and on one occasion, so little did Ellen's dress of rich moire an- tique suit the old lady's notions of what was fitting and proper, that to it might probably be attributable the more than customary ill-humour which marked her conduct. Two or three glasses of wine, instead of warming her heart, loosened and sharpened her tongue. "" Did you see those two girls, this morn- ing, with their new fly-away caps stuck all over with artificial flowers?"" said Lady Clarissa, addressing her son. u I saw that they looked very smart,"" he replied, a but I did not observe that the improvement was caused by an alteration in their caps."" n Improvement T exclaimed the old lady, angrily, "" I wonder what next you'll call an improvement !

There is no occupation so graceful and becoming as that of ar- ranging flowers — to a pretty woman at least ; but Constance, quite unconscious that she was looking very charming, went on select- ing, and grouping, and throwing some aside, until she had finished her own and her mamma's nosegay ; while Mr. Forde and Captain Bohun and her cousin stood watching her. "" Now which is the best of these two,"" said she raising her eyes to Mr. Forde ; "" take time to consider, because you know it is a very important subject."" Mr. Forde stooped down and whispered something to her ; she blushed and laughed, and shook her head. Nonsense, I dare say it was, or he would have said it out loud. However, she gave him a moss rose-bud, and went to fasten one in her papa's coat, and presented one of the bouquets to her mamma, and asked to be praised for tying it up so nicely, and then returned to her seat.

He had, when a passion for Lucy not unlike his own, the younger and shghter, had his admirers among women who could not or would not look be- neath the bland, smooth, rippling surface, to discover the rocks, the quicksands, and the slimy monsters of the deep. He had resolved to humble Lucy ; and though he would have preferred doing it by what he called fair means — namely, by his showy exterior, his flattering tongue, his atten- tions and promises — ^yet these failing, he had other, darker, and viler ways and means. He had resorted to them before ; he would again, he said, with an inward oath, if needful ; and needful he had declared they were be- come. A great additional impetus had been given to his passion for Lucy by tlie accidental dis- covery that Cecil Sydney and Henry Grevillo — of whose flat and taste he thought as a beau on the wane does of those of men about town in their prime — were smitten, the one with N 2 other with an affectionate interest which any girl might be proud to inspire.

It might have been difficult to get into ac- quaintance by means of the chit-chat of society, which requires a certain initiation ; but such a grand subject was common ground. He answered as very few of the people interrogated by the sick man did answer. He did not show either alarm or horror — he started slightly, it is true, but he answered without much hesitation : "" Yes, I have thought often of death,"" said Colin. Though he was only a second-class passenger, this was a question which put all on an equality ; and now it was not difficult to under- stand why the captain eschewed his troublesome questioner, and how the people looked embarrassed to whom he spoke.

I brooded over it, I tortured its meaning into a hundred forms—I spake of it to my friend, but in general terms, in which she seemed to acquiesce: she appeared to have made a determination, not to enquire after what I was unwilling to disclose; she wholly confided both in my principles, and in those of her son: I was wounded by what, entangled in prejudice, I conceived to be a necessity for this reserve. Again I addressed the man, whose image, in the absence of all other impressions, I had suffered to gain in my mind this dangerous ascendency. “I, once more, take up my pen with a mind so full of thought, that I foresee I am about to trespass on your time and patience—yet, perhaps, to one who makes ‘the human heart his study,’ it may not be wholly uninteresting to trace a faithful delineation of the emotions and sentiments of an ingenuous, uncorrupted, mind—a mind formed by solitude, and habits of reflection, to some strength of character. “If to have been more guarded and reserved would have been more discreet, I have already forfeited all claim to this discretion—to affect it now, would be vain, and, by pursuing a middle course, I should resign the only advantage",svenja,,

But, anyway, they now met unprepared, and in the manner that Digby, at least, would most have wished. He did not speak to her at first, how- ever ; he only stood there, looking and waiting, until at length she saw him — recalled from some long day- dream, in which he must, I think, have had a part, for his actual presence to seem so natural. Then a glad rush of colour swept her cheek for a moment, and her eyes caught a soft, sweet brightness, changing, on a sudden, to a tender pathos, which touched her lover to the heart.

The coast, bending into a bay, was rocky and bold. Lofty pinnacles, wooded to their summits, rose over the shores, and cliffs of naked marble of such gigantic proportions, that they were awful even at a distance, obtruded themselves far into the waves, breasting their eternal fury. Beyond the margin of the coast, as far as the eye could reach, appeared pointed mountains, darkened with forests, rising ridge over ridge in many successions.

The precise amount of her heiress-ship was not kndwn definitely, but it was popularly estimated as being somewhere between eighty thousand and a hundred and twenty thousand a-year ; for when people talk of sums of that magnitude they are apt to become vague, and to regard twenty thousand pounds, more or less, as the merest trifle. She was an only child, and had inherited from her parents, who were both dead, a very large fortune. And besides this she was the chosen in- heritor of Mr Carton, her father's brother, who was a childless old widower of im- mense property, and with whom she lived at Carton House. A Mrs Grey, who was a poor relation of the family, also resided there, and officiated as her chaperon ; but as Mrs Grey was a nonentity, and as Mr Carton hardly ever interfered with his niece, Ethel w^as virtually mistress of the place, and did pretty much what she liked with herself and every one and thing con- nected therewith.

But he called at inopportune times, and was not admitted ; he left his card, and his sister called and left hers ; but Miss Myles gave but a cold glance at either and forgot them, so there was no help for it ; he must make his proposals in a letter, a proceeding to which he was most averse, considering that his personality and its strong claims upon an universal admiration would thus be lost. However, he had no doubt of success ; any woman would pause twice, he considered, before committing the egregious mistake of giving a refusal to the offer of his hand — any woman of sense, that is, who was gifted with sufficient discernment to be able to appreciate both himself and his position ; and Miss Myles was a person capable of such discrimination.

Their appear- ance caught the eye of the bishop as he passed on amid ranks of bowing churchmen and kneeling knights craving his benediction, which he dispensed with due solemnity, and then, as he approached the altar, and pre- pared to change his robes for the cere- mony, sent his crosier-bearer to demand of the knights why they assumed such hostile and unwonted guise in the church.

Eugenia could not understand him. She liked, and admired him more every day, and grew more and more desirous to gain his favour, but even when she was most bright and fascinating, a strange, im- penetrable reserve pervaded him, which all her beauty and talent could not pierce. Courteous, he was, always, but she never seemed to gain ground in her intimacy with him ; and although he was friendly and cousinly enough to foster the feelings she entertained towards him, yet he was also suffi- ciently reserved to make her the more anxious, and determined on gaining her point. This was quite unintentional on Hugh's part. He admired Eugenia, and found her a pleasant, amusing companion, but beyond this he seldom thought of her at all. Perhaps she surmised this sometimes, when he was abstracted and pre-occu- pied ; but it only incited her to fresh efforts, for she had full confidence in her powers of attraction ; and, as she said to Grace in one of their private confabulations — "" ""What man is proof against a decided woman ?""",mark,,

By degrees he became gloomy and more reserv- ed ; his hand was tremulous, his cheeks colour- less, his look absent and distracted ; his eye wandering and unfixed, his sleep broken and disturbed, his appetite gone, his flesh wasted, and old age crept upon him before the time. Then reverses and losses thickened upon him, and then conscience grew powerless, and then dishonesty grew stronger and less scrupulous, and then detection followed, and exposure was feared, and wife and child were forgotten, and the poor man perished by his own hand. Strangers pitied the deserted mother and child ; the former needed not that pity long. She died, and her poor child wept upon the lifeless parent, and was left to the mercy of a wide world ; and she found many kind friends who spoke comfort to her, and as she had never been habituated to indolence and luxury, nor accustomed to a life of gaiety and thoughtless- ness, exertion, so far from being painful and humihating, became the means of diverting her mind from her sorrows, and of filling her thoughts pleasingly.

UNFORESEEN PERIL IT falls to the lot of doctors and parsons to see many strange things, and they are, or ought to be, much less easily astonished than the rest of us. Anglican clerics, it is true, learn remarkably little, as a rule, considering what their oppor- tunities are, because they lack that preliminary training which is of so much value to their brethren of the Romish communion ; but the average Enghsh doctor knows a good deal, and may be relied upon to exercise the average English common sense in dealing with the facts before him. Matthew Austin, therefore, ascribed no more importance than it deserved to an episode which might have had uncomfortable results for Miss Frere, if not for himself, nor did he think it incumbent upon him to go out of his way in order to call at Hayes Park and ascertain what he had omitted to ask on the occasion of their last meeting, whether she had effected her midnight entry without detection.

Upon this, the blood-vessels having obtained their due extent and capacity, the distending force of the blood of consequence ceases : but the moment it does, the contractive power of the nerves begins to act again, and restores them to a contracted dense state, by a force exactly equal to that which ex- tended them ; till the returning propelled blood re- enters the muscle, and stretches it again, as before described. Such are the two wonderful counter- forces that produce the natural involuntary motion of the heart, and carry on the circulation of the blood.

One friend alone alone had he found generous and dlfinter- efted enough to be fincere ; fearlefs of lof- ing his favour, difclalming to flatter his pride ; but that friend his vices had dri- ven from him, and irritated to a rafli vow of feeing him no more. Now fhut out from fociety, from the chearlng ligiit of day — doomed to capti-* vity, to fufFering, perhaps to death, — wha^ a reverfe ! In the firfl: moments of defpair, his rea-* fon feemed to have forfaken him ; — he tra- verfed his dungeon v^ath frantic fury, at- tempted to force open the dooj, and im- precated the bitterell: maledictions on thofe who had confined him.",alex,,

1239,"TRANSFUSION J OR, THE But when De Mara explained to her the diffi- culty under which he had been labouring, Made- line was too generous not to retract all she had said. '^ Forgive me, dear De Mara,"" cried she, ^* that I may forgive myself; or, if I must offer an apology for what I have said, receive it in the reflection — that warmth of feeling for neg- ' lect includes warmth of feeling for attentions, and that had you not taught me the sweets of the latter, you never would have experienced the bitter of the former."" De Mara pressed the maiden to his arms, and, kissing away the tears that hung like , drops of precious gum from some heart-healing tree, swore that he would not have had a word less said of blame, so sweetly had the pain it had inflicted been soothed by the soft bahny declara- tion that had succeeded. It was from this incident and its consequences that De Mara gathered a hght which he deter- mined should aid him in his future course. He investigated the traits of disposition Madeline had displayed in this short conversation, and he thought he plainly perceived that, to attack her on the side of her vanity, was to insure success ; and that, by properly playing her wounded self- complacency against itself, he should make him- self more entirely master and comptroller of her heart than by any other means that could be adopted.",svenja,,
1240,"It was all over and done with, he said, and the land was his, and Harris ought not to have received the money, which he offered to give back to me then and there. When he found that I refused to believe him, or to give up the quittance that Harris had signed on behalf of the firm, he offered to buy the farm for a larger sum than I had just repaid him. It was fully more than the land would have been worth in open market, but I told him plainly that I wish- ed to have no dealings with him, and that Ave had sold the Shropshire property simply that we might not have to break our fenee here. 1 Then he swore that since I would not sell he would make me glad to give, and he brought out what you will find with this. c Copies, you will understand.

1241,"So reasoned the good attorney, as with a languid smile and a sigh of content, his long hand laid across the cover of the despatch-box by his side, he looked forth through the plate-glass window upon the sunny fields and hedgerows that glided by him, and felt the blessed assurance, 'look, whatsoever he doeth it shall prosper,' mingling in the hum of surrounding nature. And as his eyes rested on the flying diorama of trees, and farmsteads, and standing crops, and he felt already the pride of a great landed proprietor, his long fingers fiddled pleasantly with the rough tooling of his morocco leather box; and thinking of the signed articles within, it seemed as though an angelic hand had placed them there while he slept, so wondrous was it all; and he fancied under the red tape a label traced in the neatest scrivenery, with a pencil of light, containing such gratifying testimonials to his deserts, 'as well done good and faithful servant,' 'the saints shall inherit the earth,' and so following; and he sighed again in the delicious luxury of having secured both heaven and mammon. And in this happy state, and volunteering all manner of courtesies, opening and shutting windows, lending his railway guide and his newspapers whenever he had an opportunity, he at length reached the great London terminus, and was rattling over the metropolitan pavement, with his hand on his despatch-box, to his cheap hotel near the Strand.

Joan clapped the door with a little noise behind her, so as to obliterate this word, which her grandmother would have used with the greatest openness, but which the progress of civilisation has made less possible even in the free-speaking north ; but it relieved her mind to say it, though she took pains that it should not be heard. As for the two women, they laughed with little sound, but much demonstration, when tUe door was closed ; one of them throwing her- self upon a chair in convulsions of suppressed mirth. "" Auld Joan, t'auld toad, has gotten a lad at last,"" they said. The idea that she had been shut out in the cold in this very unusual court- ship was such a joke to them as no wit could have equalled.

1250,"Inglesant's departure from Umbria was so sudden that he had no opportunity of again seeing the stranger whom he had left in the palace, and he was afterwards at some trouble in obtaining any information respecting him. As far as could be ascertained he waited in the palace, according to his promise, until the evening, when, finding that Inglesant did not return, he walked quietly forth, no man hindering him. What his JOHN INGLESANT ; [chap. vn. subsequent fate was is involved in some obscurity ; but it would appear that, having pubhcly insulted the Host in some cathe- dral in the south of Italy, he was arrested by the Holy Office, and thrown into prison, from which there is reason to believe he never emerged. CHAPTER VIII. NOT very long after Inglesant had left for Umbria, his friend, Don Agostino di Chigi, suddenly came to Rome. The Pope's health was rapidly failing, and the excite- ment concerning his successor was becoming intense. The choice was generally considered to lie between the Cardinals Barbarini and di Chigi, though Cardinal Sacchetti was spoken of by some, probably however merely as a substitute, should both the other parties fail in electing their candidate.",matt,,
