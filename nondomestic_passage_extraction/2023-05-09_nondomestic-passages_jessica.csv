753,"The mountains of the Ngome, and over- looking the forest of that name, are flat- topped, like all others in South Africa ; but Major Marter found the western slope to be dangerously precipitous, and thence he and his guides looked down into a densely wooded valley, lying more than two thousand feet below. About two miles distant, thin smoke could be seen ascending amid the greenery, from a small kraal by the side of a brawling stream, and therein Cetewayo was known to be. As cavalry could not reach the bottom without making a very long detour, the Major ordered all the mounted men to lay aside their bright steel scabbards, and all Other accoutrements likely to create a rattling noise, and these, with the pack horses, were left in charge of a small party, the command of which was offered to the sinking Florian, who foolishly declined, and rode with the rest to a less precipitous slope of the hills three miles distant, down which the Dragoon Guards led their chargers by the bridle, crossed the stream referred to, a small fence, and a marsh, and, remounting, made a dash for the kraal, sword in hand, from the north, while the Native Contingent formed up south of it on some open ground. The capture of Cetewayo is an event too recent to be detailed at length here. It is known how his few followers, on seeing the red-coated cavalry riding up, shouted, in unison with the Native Contingent: * The white men are here — you are taken !' Then the fallen royal savage came forth, looking weary, weak, and footsore ; and when a soldier — Tom Tyrrell — attempted to seize him, he drew himself up with an air of simple dignity, and repelled him.",jessica,,
758,"An hour^ nor yet a couple was sufficient to talk over the one half we had to say ; so we willingly accepted an invitation to dinner, I having already declared my intention of walk- ing to Mansfield Lodge, which was not less than three miles off. Dr. Tomkins, I have little doubt, fathomed my melancholy motives for this stroll ; for I perceived him cast a signi- ficant glance towards his sister, which was returned by one equally expressive of concern on her part, though not a single observation escaped them. As for myself I knew per- fectly what was passing in their minds, (for they knew of my unfortunate amour, although mistaken as to the object,) and my confusion must have been sufficiently obvious to them as quitting the Parsonage, we directed our steps towards a place which abounded with as many melancholy remembrances as my own family mansion. After following the high road for upwards of a mile, I struck into a by path, that in- tersected that lane about the very spot, where I first met with Mansfield and his daughters, when he himself was so brutally assaulted by his Irish steward. The nearer I drew to this well remembered place, the more overpowering became my feehngs ; and Foster who well knew the cause, had the kind dehcacy to Unger pur- posely behind, so as to keep me within sight without intruding upon my sorrows. At length I came to the old twisted iron gate of the avenue, the lower portion of which was matted with weeds and briars ; and alas !",jessica,,
763,"Several months past he had applied for permission to be admitted a student at the senior department of that establishment ; but other, and much more engrossing events having intervened, the college had completely vanished from his thoughts, and the pre- paration necessary for his entrance exami- nation. The month of January had already com- menced, and the cornet was summoned to appear at Sandhurst on the first of the ensuing February. Not a single book, connected with the college course, had been looked into by him— even his school arithmetic had not been refreshed — decimals, fractions, and proportion, he recollected but the names of. The cornet numbered the few days that were allowed him for preparation, and trembled. "" Every candidate,"" say the regulations for the students of the senior department of the Royal Military College, "" will have to undergo an examination previous to admission. The examination will be chiefly in the elements of geometry ; but if deemed necessary, it will be extended to other elementary puts of education requisite to qualify ham for making progress in the branches of instruction taught at the col- lege."" Pierce looked out in his pocket Johnson for the word "" geometry,"" and found that it was a noun substantive, signifying "" the science of quantity, extension, or magnitude, abstractedly considered.""",jessica,,
768,"As a rule, our friend seems to me to walk backwards and forwards too much while he's painting a canvas. I often advised him to sit more still. If you watch any of the great masters at work, I always sa}', you'll see them seated so close at their easels. and so certain of the value of every particular touch, that they never need to look at the total effect they're producing at all. That's art : that's the master's way of working. Corot said there were certain pictures of his which he never really saw in any true sense of the word till they'd been signed and framed and sold and paid for.

773,"""We aren't so ambitious as you seem to think ; but we do what little we can."" Lord Walter had at one time examined into the social problems arising out of excess of population, over-crowding, com- petition, drunkenness and the like, and had read a great many Blue Books bearing upon these subjects. The conclusion at which he had arrived was a disheartening one, and it made him impatient of the futile panaceas of well-meaning persons. Nevertheless, he admired Miss Shafto for engaging in a kindly work — or else he admired the work because Miss Shafto was engaged in it. Possibly, if she had been a sour- faced old maid, with a pair of spec- tacles and a dowdy gown, he would have changed the subject ; but as it was, a five- pound note was withdrawn from his pocket and placed in the young lady's white palm. ""I'll do likewise,"" said he; ''I'll do what little I can."" Whereupon Miss Shafto pointed out to him that, although five-pound notes were all very well and they were much indebted to him for his generosity, that was not quite all that he could do towards helping his less fortunate fellow-creatures.

788,"I take my wide-awake from the peg, set it on one side my head, and strut whistling out of the hall door. I stretch over Putney Heath, and my spirit resumes its tranquillity. I sometimes keep a little journal of my proceedings, and on referring to its pages, the scene rises before me pretty clearly to which the brief notes allude. On this day I find noted: “Friday, July 14.—B. came down to-day.

793,"In a little time after, while Sigismund remained per- ple.xed by the parting word of Basilius, his attention was attracted by the entrance of Rosaura who now ap- peared dressed in her own habiliments. She was pro- ceeding in search of Estrella, anxious at the same time to avoid the sight of Astolpho, Clotaldus having advised her to leave him in ignorance of her presence at the court of Poland. She felt grateful to Clotaldus for the interest which he appeared to take in"" her for- tunes, and readily submitted to his guidance. "" What,"" said Clarin to Sigismund, "" has pleased thee most of all that thou hast seen this morning?"" "" Nothing has surprised me,"" said Sigismund, "" for I have seen nothing here that my education did not in some measure enable me to anticipate. But if my admiration has been really moved at all, it has been by the beauty of the ladies who have left us."" At this moment perceiving Rosaura about to retire, he started forward and detaining her exclaimed. '' what do I see.",jessica,,
798,"They men- tioned the prudent design of Lord Orient to send his sisters to Lady Diana Benmore, without exposing Mrs. How- ard's faux-pas, in hopes it might be for- gotten after she had resided for some time in Glenfinlas Castle with a lady so famed for her prudence. The whole of their conversation appeared so plausible and friendly in regard to the Orients, and so feeling whenever Amelia or himself were men- tioned, that he found it almost impossi- ble ble to doubt the truth of what they said ; yet he was resolved not to con- demn his Amelia until he obtained fur- ther assurances of her infidelity. He wished to see the speakers, but did not choose to discover himself in the agi- tated state of his mind ; for he plainly understood by their discourse, that how- ever innocent his wife might be in reality, appearances were against her ; and that, to his delicate ideas of female honor, was nearly as disgraceful as actual guilt. He heard them say, that they must prepare to attend the levee ; he was obliged to do the same, and expected to have a private conference with His Majesty, therefore thought it his duty to banish, as much as possible, all ail private concerns from his mind, and devote it solely to the business of his king and country. He was received and rewarded by His Majesty as a hero ought to be : the King addressed him as the Earl of Win- fort, and ordered his patent for that honorable and gloriously acquired title to be presented to him. He was intro- duced to the Queen.",jessica,,
803,"“To be sure, he canna but hae heard,” said the good woman. “Ay, to be sure, it's impossible but I should,” said Caleb; “and sae I'll be the first to kiss ye, joe, and wish you, cooper, much joy of your preferment, naething doubting but ye ken wha are your friends, and have helped ye, and can help ye. I thought it right to look a wee strange upon it at first,” added Caleb, “just to see if ye were made of the right mettle—but ye ring true, lad, ye ring true!” So saying, with a most lordly air he kissed the women, and abandoned his hand, with an air of serene patronage, to the hearty shake of Mr Girder's horn-hard palm. Upon this complete, and to Caleb most satisfactory, information, he did not, it may readily be believed, hesitate to accept an invitation to a solemn feast, to which were invited, not only all the notables of the village, but even his ancient antagonist, Mr Dingwall himself. At this festivity he was, of course, the most welcome and most honoured guest; and so well did he ply the company with stories of what he could do with his master, his master with the Lord Keeper, the Lord Keeper with the Council, and the Council with the King, that before the company dismissed, (which was, indeed, rather at an early hour than a late one,) every man of note in the village was ascending to the top-gallant of some ideal preferment by the ladder of ropes which Caleb had presented to their imagination. Nay, the cunning butler regained in that moment, not only all the influence he possessed formerly over the villagers, when the baronial family which he served were at the proudest, but acquired even an accession of importance.",jessica,,
808,"Such feelings, although frequent, were, however, evanescent enough. His life, as has been said, went on much like any other idle man's. He lounged, and rode, and read, in his usual desultory way ; he feasted, nay he flirted willingly, though aimlessly enough, with the beautiful Edith. Hers was a heart not easily to be broken, and there was scarcely anybody but himself now left in town for the poor girl to practise upon. Why should not she be gratified with the idea that he was being enthralled ? She certainly did not love him ; and when he was dead, if the rumour of there having been any tendresse between them should get abroad, it would only make her the more interesting. He would take care that matters should never go so far as to compel her to put on mourning, which she had confided to him did not become her.",jessica,,

843,"Pardon, I conjure you, most amiable of women, what has justly raised your displeasure, and by me it shall never again be excited ! I will now leave you, but you must not deprive me of the hope of being received to-m.orrow without disgust."" The ]\ Iarquis withdrew without giving her time to refuse this request, and pro- ceeded immediately to the habitation of Countess Almerini, whose sentiments he was well assured of, and w4io would not be averse he imagined, to assist him in estranging Rosaura from Count Orvino, since he found that his threats and the terror he had meant to inspire, liad availed so little. To detain Rosaura in Naples, was a part of his plan, and to alarm her delicacy M'ith regard to the propriety of still suffering the attendance of the Count, by perpetually uttering suspicions which would shock her ideas of decorum, was the first effort which that plan suggested, and and of which the complete ruin of lluvcllo M'as the foundation. After his departure, llosaura could not but reflect upon the unprotected situation- in which she now found herself: her husband in confinement, his effects seized, and herself compelled to solicit the aid of people whose good opinion and considera- tion rise with the prosperity of those whom tliey call friends, who think tlie desertion, of Fortune the indication of every crime, and her smile the stamp of perfection. She failed not to discover in the expres* sions and the regards of the men, a freedom of admiration M'hich they had never before ventured to betray, a certain confidence which sensitive delicacy alone could discern, and wliich her situation as a petitioner must forbid her to repress with that resolution which could alone be effectual.",jessica,,
848,"But the pleasure had been hers. She was not dis- posed to consider whether he were sufficiently mindful of her or no, as he put his arms round her waist, kissed her again and again, and called her "" a foolish little thing to spend so much time and trouble upon a schoolboy as he was."" But still Alice worked his favourite colours, sang his favourite songs, learnt by heart out of his favourite authors, and strove to hide her tears when he went back to school. It never occurred to her that, though he looked grieved for a moment to see her sad, and in the most affectionate manner told her not to be unhappy, his lightheadedness never entirely forsook him, even on the eve of a six months' separation; or if she looked deeper than usual, she attributed his gaiety to the wish of lightening her own sorrow, or to the naturally joyous anticipation of rejoin- ing his school companions. Ormond really loved her dearly, thought her the nicest, prettiest, dearest little crea- ture in the world. If he wanted any one to console him. he would seek her; if moody, and somewhat out of humour with himself or others, he longed for her smile to console him ; if happy, he thought how her presence would heighten his enjoyment.",jessica,,
853,"It is of a more important nature than the others,"" replied Arthur, "" but I do not think you will refuse it. Your marriage was a terrible mistake, and evil has been the fruit of it. Be- tween you and Lady Glendale love is impossible, and even friendly affection can only be the slow growth of time. But you can exercise courtesy and forbearance towards her, you can give her the common deference a gentleman gives a lady, in a word you can make her life a little less like hell than it has been lately. My third and last demand is that you will solemnly swear to me to-night that you will make earnest efforts to do so.""

Honor made way instantly ; and then exerted herself to manage the spirited creature she rode, and keep pace with the cavalcade. The level plain was passed at a canter ; and they descended, at a somewhat slower rate, a hill which dipped into a bottom, where sallow bushes betrayed the presence of a stream that first trickled across a road ('^ The Hollow Way,"" as Katy called it,) which seemed hardly wide enough for the carriage, and crept winding up the lofty hill that fronted them ; the steepness being somewhat mitigated by the road sloping diagonally round the shoulder of the hill to the top.

"" Now which is the best of these two,"" said she raising her eyes to Mr. Forde ; "" take time to consider, because you know it is a very important subject.""

943,"Having reached an eminence, where the trees were more thinly scattered, Ellena perceived the forests spreading on all sides among hills and vallies, and descending towards the Adriatic, which bounded the distance in front. The coast, bending into a bay, was rocky and bold. Lofty pinnacles, wooded to their summits, rose over the shores, and cliffs of naked marble of such gigantic proportions, that they were awful even at a distance, obtruded themselves far into the waves, breasting their eternal fury. Beyond the margin of the coast, as far as the eye could reach, appeared pointed mountains, darkened with forests, rising ridge over ridge in many successions. Ellena, as she surveyed this wild scenery, felt as if she was going into eternal banishment from society. She was tranquil, but it was with the quietness of exhausted grief, not of resignation; and she looked back upon the past, and awaited the future, with a kind of out-breathed despair.

But Demoiselle, here, scorns all that namby pamby work.” Sir Jaspar tried vainly to call him to order; the embarrassment of Juliet operated but as a stimulus to his caustic humour. “I have met with nothing like her, Master Baronet,” he continued, “all the globe over. Neither juggler nor conjuror is a match for her. She can make herself as ugly as a witch, and as handsome as an angel.

1163,"""After a close confinement of nearly two months, I was summoned before the tribunal of this court, and there charged with heresy. Filled with astonishment at this extraordinary accusation, I firmly protested my innocence, and declared my attachment to the Romish church ; but they in- teiTupted me, by inquiring if my father had not embraced the Protestant faith ; as this was a fact I could not deny, I candidly answered in the affirmative, but at the same time assured them that I had been brought up in the catholic re- ligioii, to which I should ever adhere, and that I had never violated, in the smallest degree, either its principles or its privileges. "" No answer was returned to these words, save a smile of contempt, and a command to confess my guilt ; and by so doing, they added, I shoiUd be entitled to the lenity of the court : but I still con- tinued to deny the charges exhibited against me, and awaited my doom w'ith an unaltered coun- tenance. I was, however, shortly returned to my celJ, and after another month had elapsed, was brought forth for a second examination, was con- victed, and condemned to be broken upon the wheel. My distracted wife, on hearing the issue of these proceedings, flew to her relations, who w^ere high in powder, to beg their interference, in trying to save the life of her husband. This they promised to do, and accordingly ventured to solicit an audience of the king, who coldly informed them that it was not his prerogative to alter the verdict of the inquisitorial court, but that he would extend his clemency so far as to attempt something in my favour. My sentence was after- wards mitigated to pcrjietual banishment from my native country, and that if ever I again set foot in any part of his majesty's dominions, the sentence should be executed upon me in all its rigour.",jessica,,
