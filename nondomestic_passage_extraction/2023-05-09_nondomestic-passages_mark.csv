751,"Some weighty matter was evidently before his mind. Suddenly he seemed to see light. With an air of great good fellowship, he exclaimed, — ' As sure as my name is Mr Mungo Mauch- line, and if I am anny joodge of the weather, .this is a shuperfine day.' There was really nothing special about the day; but Mr Mungo Mauchline objected to undue familiarity ; and this was his way of making known how he chose to be called. 'It's a geyan coorse day,' returned Mrs Gillespie, in an injured tone ; thinking of the effects of that draught upon her ' hoast.' ' Yes, there is a wind into it, I own,' granted Mr Mungo Mauchline, as if the day were his, and he responsible for the quality of it ; ' there is a little wind into it too — nut a rantin', tantin', tearin' wind ; but a nookin', soughin', wurnin' wind, as the minister in the story says.' ' Jist a wheen claivers, a' thae stories aboot ministers,' cried Mrs Gillespie tartly ; ' min- isters is nane dafter nor ither folk, an' no sae daft as some, Mungo.' '",mark,,
756,"But my monkey was up, and I was determined to see what it was, so I lit a candle and went back. Then, by groping about, I discovered that secret passage leading through into the other side ; and, never hesitating, I explored it at once, and the next minute found myself in the opposite bed-room ; but, raising my candle a little, I saw a female in bed, and so hooked it out again sharp; though I must tell you that, just as I got through into her room, I twigged the door at the further side closing on somebody in the act of going out."" ""This is most extraordinary,"" exclaimed Agnes, with a look of alarm ; "" for they tell me that Lizzie's door was found unfastened this morning, and she declares she locked it last night."" "" Go on, boy, go on ; is that all ?"" asked Grumpy, impa- tiently. "" Not quite. I got back to my room (shoved on some clothes, for it was precious cold), and then went straight off to the Rajah's—"" ""You mean the Captain's?"" suggested Grumpy. ""Captain Helfernan's, yes — when I noticed, curiously enough, that my door was standing ajar — "" """,mark,,

771,"My Amelia, who was the belt of wives and mothers, endeavoured often to inspire her with a love of neatneSs and ceconomy, but but fhe was too young and thoughtless to give ear to any argument on the subject."" The old man appeared so much affected with what he had related, that Madame de St. Claire begged he would defer the remainder of his history till the afternoon, or another opportunity.. The children appeared greatly intereited in what they had heard. In the molt pathetic parts, Emmiline had been obServed to put her handkerchief to her eyes ; and when De Livré left off speaking, flic jumped upon his knee, and throwing her little arms around his neck, exclaimed, "" Wicked boy! to behave so ill to so good a father! But do not grieve about him now; mamma, I am sure, will always be your friend, and if we are not too young, let us be your friends also? My brother, though a little vain, is a good boy ; the more you know of him, the more you will like him; and you will love Clara too, who I am sure d 2 would would work Sor you with all her heart.",mark,,
776,"It must be so bitterly painful for a parent to be renounced by a child ; and thee, poor rash boy ! how I pity thee ! If she should fall ill, and if thy letter should de- stroy her !"" "" Sir, if you have any humanity, do not conjure up that horrible image again."" "" No, not if thou wilt conjure it away thyself, by writing another and a better letter to thy mother."" "" I should be ashamed to write such a one so soon after the other."" "" No : it is of the first letter thou shouldst be ashamed, not of the second.",mark,,
781,"Julia was not at all immoderate, for she had been schooled, in the matter of love, in the most rigid principles of courtship, and had learnt to restrain her own feelings, and not to be at all surprised or disappointed in the corres- ponding self-restraint on the part of her lover. Morey very soon brought about a revolution in Julia's maidenly consciousness and expect- ations, and he was delighted to find that she quite enjoyed the change, and would respond to him as demonstratively as he could reason- ably expect. Morey was all that her heart could desire, and she was not ashamed now to confess that she loved him very dearly, and would have him whether her uncle approved of it or not. He might disown her and leave her penniless, if he could be so prejudiced and cruel, but have Morey she would ; no sacrifice was now too great to make for love like his. Morey Maguire always had abundance of spirits, and could always make himself agree- able, especially in the society of ladies. His humour was never of that flimsy kind which indicates the consciousness that ladies are always to be entertained by something light and frivolous. He never condescended to this, for he held woman in very profound respect, and with some differences in his feelings, which no woman can reasonably find fault with or resent — for they were purely feelings of greater tenderness and courtesy, — he always treated them as possess- ing equal intelligence with himself, and as participating in the same lively interests of which he himself was conscious.",mark,,
786,"It was a phan- tom with which I was to become familiar indeed, before I had finished with Boule-de- neiofe and his master. It was clear that the demon to whom I had sold myself was incapable of the slightest consideration towards me. He would eat and drink as much as he felt disposed to do, careless of any consequences that might befall me. It was equally evident that he intended to make the most of his bargain, to eat enormously every day, and to drink him- self drunk every night. And I was power- less. Meantime it was becomins: evident that the consequences to me would be as serious as if I were myself guilty of these •excesses. One drop of comfort alone re- mained : my appetite would fail, and my tormentor would be punished where he would feel it most.",mark,,

796,"That would embarrass his flight too much."" "" His flight."" '' Alas ! poor child — that is the rude, but too significant word — yes, flight from his creditors — escape from those proceedings on the part of his creditors which I very much fear would end in worse than flight."" "" Does my mother know ? "" "" No — she suspects nothing of this. She c2 is aware of the great distress your father is in for money ; and has often been obliged to adopt those means advised by an iniquitous steward, which are certain to end in ruin; he has long been battening, as I suspect, upon your father's property — but your mother is still ignorant of the whole extent of the evil and of the rapid approach of the last catastrophe. Yfrits will be out against your father in a few days — I happen to know it with certainty.""",mark,,
801,"But not for long,"" rather sharply. '' Well, I don't know ; if you mean about Ghosty Moore, of course they like one another, and the Moores are fond of Betty, but nothing is positively settled as yet. I would never have got off without her, never have been ready in time ; you really owe her a debt of gratitude, she worked almost day and night, and packed my boxes, and altered my dresses, and thought of every detail down to fans and oranges for the Red Sea. I shall miss her terribly. If there is any hitch about her marrying Ghosty Moore, we must have her out on a visit by and by, what do you think ? "" George became very white, and made no reply. "" I know you like her, for you have often said so, and she TS'ould not be with us very long.",mark,,
806,"if not, get them without delay, "" Memoirs of the Klopstocks,"" lam delighted with the contemplation of two human beings more, exalted and heavenly in their feelings and affections, than any I have met with under similar circumstances. That a man of so rationally pious and glowing a heart should have met with a woman so conge- nial in spirit, is wonderful. This was too perfect a state of happiness to continue ; they were only united here, to pant for a re-union in a more perfect state. How sweetly does one of her letters to Ri- chardson, pourtray her early admiration of Klopstock, as a writer ; her subsequent friendship friendship, and final attachment, all in the genuine openness of a pure and art- less heart. Such as the following, in another letter, is not always the language, I apprehend, of youthful lovers. "" Farewell, my beloved ; I shall think of you to-morrow. The holiest thoughts harmonize with my ideas of you : of you who are more holy than I am ; who love our great Creator not less than I do ; more, I think, you cannot love him.",mark,,
811,"He informed them that he was about to undertake a very long journey, and that he should be absent at least four months. It ap- peared that in consequence of the death of Mr. Oldbourn, one of Mr. Fairfax's clients, it be- came expedient to recall the brother of that client from Asia, where he was travelling ; for according to the tenor of the will, it was neces- sary that he should fulfil certain provisions within a limited period. Mark announced that he had been appointed to proceed in search of this gentleman. "" You see,"" said he, "" as I am a. dab Sit French, Mr. Fairfax has selected me to perform this out-of-the-way concern. It will be rum work, I dare say, for everybody says that foreigners are queer chaps."" Many were the expressions of regret upon hearing this piece of intelligence; for to lose a friend, when distress is at hand, is very much like breakino: a link of the drag-chain when going down hill.",mark,,

"" Sir John does not care for these sort of things, he was always pleased when I was always pleased ; and all our little talks we did here ; and then the children — all that they had to say to mamma, this was the place.

"" That's a sneezer,"" again said Tom, as they came to a rattling double ; the further rail, however, not being so strong as it might have been, would give a chance of getting through, if not over, safely. There was a deep ditch between the rails, running water below, and some very prickly cut blackthorns strewed over it — a sort of open drain.

891,"As to poor Frank Fordyce, I never saw him so distressed ; he felt as if it were all his own fault, or that of his ancestors, and, whenever he was not required by his duties, was lingering about for news. I had little hope, though Clarence seemed to me the very light of my eyes ; it was to me as though, his task being accomplished, and the earthly reward denied, he must be on his way to the higher one. His complete quiescence confirmed me in the assurance that he thought so himself. He was too ill for speech, but Lawrence, who could not stay away, was struck with the difference from former times. Not only were there no delusions, but there was no anxiety or uneasiness, as there had always been in the former attacks, when he was evidently ea^er to live, and still more solicitous to be told if he were in a hopeless state. Now he had plainly resigned himself — ' Content to live, but not afraid to die ; ' and perhaps, dear fellow, it was chiefly for my sake that he was willing to live. At least, I know that when the worst was over, he announced it by putting those wasted fingers into mine, and saying— ' Well, dear old fellow, I believe we shall jog on together, after all/ That attack, though the most severe of all, brought, either owing to skilful treatment or to his own calm, the removal of the mischief, and the beginning of real recovery.",mark,,

901,"Anger, jealousy, pride ; — every painful feeling k 5 was forgotten ; she remembered only that she loved, — she felt only that she was beloved. Ha- milton was charmed with the sweet contest of every emotion, most lovely in the female heart, which he so easily read in her eloquent counte- nance, and which all terminated in such fond forgiveness and generous confidence. "" Yes,"" he internally exclaimed, ""she shall be the wife of my bosom, the mother of my children ! — she shall know my every thought and share my every feeling."" And whilst he thus gave way to his own natural generosity, he gazed with all the pride of anticipated possession, upon her, as her cheek mantled with the richest vermilion, and her eyes beamed with softer brilliancy through the tears that glistened on their lashes, like dew-drops gemming the stalk of a moss-rose. Easily susceptible of refine- ment, Catherine had, unconsciously to herself, acquired an air of dignity and fashion in the society with which she had been surrounded ever since her arrival in town, which delighted Hamilton, and which added to the pomp of Mr, Longcroft's establishment, the obstacles opposed by etiquette to his frequently seeing her, and even the marked discouragement which both Louisa and Edward manifested of his proffered visit, all gave her new consequence in his eyes ; and instead of fancying, as he did in his unrivalled self-importance at Nethercross, that he was doing her the honour in permitting himself to be attracted by her charms, he now felt himself the real admirer of her graces, the lover of her virtues, and consequently with the jealousy inseparable from such feelings, anxi- ous to secure her to himself.

I did not understand it at the time; I was solely occupied with my delight at the idea of being with him again after so long- a separation. Some little while afterwards I looked back upon it, and appreciated it. ^* We shall be a whole day's journey distant from the boj^, if he remains here,"" observed Mr. TyrreU. ^' True/' replied I, carelessly ; "" but Dr. Ulloa says that he has a feeble constitution, and that his best chance of health is to Hve in this air for the next few months.

He had resolved to humble Lucy ; and though he would have preferred doing it by what he called fair means — namely, by his showy exterior, his flattering tongue, his atten- tions and promises — ^yet these failing, he had other, darker, and viler ways and means. He had resorted to them before ; he would again, he said, with an inward oath, if needful ; and needful he had declared they were be- come. A great additional impetus had been given to his passion for Lucy by tlie accidental dis- covery that Cecil Sydney and Henry Grevillo — of whose flat and taste he thought as a beau on the wane does of those of men about town in their prime — were smitten, the one with N 2 other with an affectionate interest which any girl might be proud to inspire.

936,"It may be that she did not know the interest that linked those two together : it may be that she left it to Lord Eversleigh (who, though residing at the Castle, was a frequent, nay, a daily guest) to impart it to his daughter, when and how he deemed most fitting. But, anyway, they now met unprepared, and in the manner that Digby, at least, would most have wished. He did not speak to her at first, how- ever ; he only stood there, looking and waiting, until at length she saw him — recalled from some long day- dream, in which he must, I think, have had a part, for his actual presence to seem so natural. Then a glad rush of colour swept her cheek for a moment, and her eyes caught a soft, sweet brightness, changing, on a sudden, to a tender pathos, which touched her lover to the heart. He knew it was not for his sake that she had come thither, that she had braved the long journey, and encountered so many perils ; it was not for him that she had sat there waiting, looking down upon the busy street, yet seeing so little of what passed before her ; it was not to speak to him or to listen to his pleading, and yet, none the less, her presence came to him with a flood of rejoicing, a keenness of pleasure, such as his varied life had but too seldom yielded him. And to Maud his coming sudden and unexpected was fraught with eager thankfuhiess and gladness. She had deemed him far away in sunny, sea-girt Jersey, with the Httle Prince of Wales, or maybe with the Queen in Paris ; or even, as her father fancied, with Ormond in Ireland ; and now that he was once again beside her, the hopes which had before been wavering, brightened to life again in the sunshine of his presence.",mark,,

She had seen her mother, as usual, early that morning, but had seen nothing to excite alarm; when again she stood by her bed-side, her father's remark recurred to her memory. "" You are late, this morning, mamma,"" she said; "" I thought I should have found you up."" """,mark,,

They did make a fool of the poor bird, but it must have been a bit of a fool, to begin with, to have got itself into such a position. The menu was as follows : clear gravy soup, salmon cutlets, and fillets of sole ^ la reine, duck and lamb's fry, saddle of mutton, asparagus, eggs, and potatoes a I'ltalienne, stewed pigeon, French beans sautes, roulade of veal, and spinach a la reine, almond cream, and cheese fondu, followed up by ices, cura^oa, coffee, etc. "" Well, how's ' the Plan ' been doing these last few weeks, eh?"" asked Lenoir, who, by this distance in the dinner, had reached a state of mind which might almost be described as cordial Bangs, Crispy and the Blusterer were three American- Irish agitators, who had only arrived from Ireland the night before, where they had been stumping the country^ and collecting the sinews of war for dinners such as the present one.

It is valuable only as it throws light upon Denis's ultimate situation in life, which, after all, was not what our readers might be inclined to expect.

"" I'll give you as many as you please,"" said Blanche, throwing her arms round his neck. Marmaduke smiled as he pressed the litde girl to his heart, and wished her good-bye, while he kept soliloquising the words, "" poor child ! — poor child !"" till he reached Carlton's door. He found him up, but looking dreadfully pale and ill, with a look of fixed despair that was perfectly appalling.

1206,"He decided, no. It was not the giving up of independence — it was the bending to a superior being which, when that attitude was self- elected, was the highest independence. Here all was secure, safe, assured. Nothing would ever change the love of these two for him : outside there, where Adrienne was, all was stormy, cloudy, feverish, uncertain : he knew not what she thought of him — what feelings or no-feelings her gracious manner might cover. He had defended her — from the first mo- ment of their intercourse his attitude had been made by circumstances a protecting one : he felt at once an inferiority and a superiority to her, which two things do surely form part of the primal basis of pure and hoty love. He stood still, leaning against the chimney-piece, thinking of what he had this night done for her sake, and his face flushed at the remembrance. * Can she ever be like another woman to me V he thought.

Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble. The next morning he and I set out on foot for the “Admiral Benbow,” and there I found my mother in good health and spirits. The captain, who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked cease from troubling. The squire had had everything repaired, and the public rooms and the sign repainted, and had added some furniture—above all a beautiful arm-chair for mother in the bar. He had found her a boy as an apprentice also, so that she should not want help while I was gone. It was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time, my situation.",mark,,

Some men govern themselves too well to allow their weakness to overtake them, and become., if anything, colder in the presence of their love. This may be re- markably clever, and denote a strong mind, but it is excessively puzzling and quite unnecessary. In loving some woman well enough to cherish and protect her all your life, w^e can see nothing to be ashamed of, or mysterious about, and it causes some dreadful errors that can never be corrected. A girl subjected to this silence and cold- ness will doubt her own heart, and believ- ing herself mistaken, set up affected in- difference.

1241,"So reasoned the good attorney, as with a languid smile and a sigh of content, his long hand laid across the cover of the despatch-box by his side, he looked forth through the plate-glass window upon the sunny fields and hedgerows that glided by him, and felt the blessed assurance, 'look, whatsoever he doeth it shall prosper,' mingling in the hum of surrounding nature. And as his eyes rested on the flying diorama of trees, and farmsteads, and standing crops, and he felt already the pride of a great landed proprietor, his long fingers fiddled pleasantly with the rough tooling of his morocco leather box; and thinking of the signed articles within, it seemed as though an angelic hand had placed them there while he slept, so wondrous was it all; and he fancied under the red tape a label traced in the neatest scrivenery, with a pencil of light, containing such gratifying testimonials to his deserts, 'as well done good and faithful servant,' 'the saints shall inherit the earth,' and so following; and he sighed again in the delicious luxury of having secured both heaven and mammon. And in this happy state, and volunteering all manner of courtesies, opening and shutting windows, lending his railway guide and his newspapers whenever he had an opportunity, he at length reached the great London terminus, and was rattling over the metropolitan pavement, with his hand on his despatch-box, to his cheap hotel near the Strand.
