755,"Mrs. Brunton received ihcm with great cordialüy., and her piain, but komfortable dinncr was relished better by her guests from not being accom- panied by the usual excuses of being quite unprepared, and vastly sorry ihere was nothing fit to eat, which, in fact, is only a civil way of telling your guests you had rather they dined any where eise "" I am at this moment in the most disagreeable Situation/' said Mrs. Brunton, after dinner. "" I have an excellent offer for my lodgings, which at present are empty, but I know not what to do with a poor woinan who has been with nie for some time, sincc the new-comers will want every room I can spare from my own family, and she is in a very bad state of health. I have tried round the neighbourhood to get her a lodging in vain, and what is to becom3 of her I cannot teil ; she ii 6 talks, indeed, of going to Service, but I am sure she will be a long timc, if ever, before she recovers her strength."" "" What is her disorder ?"" asked Miss Wilmot. "" A nervous fever/' was the replv, "" brought on by extreme ill usagc from her husband. — About three months ago, they took my lodgings, and he pretended to have property in? America ; but I soon understood from her, that what they had had was con- verted into cash, and she was fearful Mr. Brown was dissipating it very fast. "" Poor thing !",matt,,
760,"she's up to fun. Why, bless you, my dear, we chuckled together as if we'd seen into one another's thoughts. She did not mind my cap, nor my wig ! not she ! You may call her eyes beautiful if you will. They are windows to her soul, just as eyes are meant to be ; not bits of stained glass to prevent your seeing out or in. What's the tall man's name?",matt,,
765,"But, mamma, Frank will get on, I'm sure. Kate said in her letter she knew he was doing well. He is very clever. He can paint beautifully; and it was only the other evening, at the rector}^, that Mr. Nelson said artists were just as well off as any other professional men, and as well thought of If he likes painting better than anything else, and sees his way to get on, why should he not be an artist ?"" "" Nonsense, child,"" was her mother's answer to Grace's special pleading. And then Mrs. Heath- cote explained, for the hundredth time, the reasons why Frank could never, by any possibility, be in a position to marry. "" Besides, if Kate knows he is doing very well in London, it is a strange thing they don't know where he lives.",matt,,
770,"Lady Jerningham and I made him a visit to- (iay — it was an affecting one — he -is 'indeed greatly reduced, subdued, and softened ; composure had taken place of that that elation, that agitated state of spiritSj the giving way to which had nearly proved fatal to him ;— after looking at Lady Jerningham for a minute — '' Alas ! how plainly do I read in the counte- nances of my dear friends, the anxiety and pain that I have caused them : NoWy indeed, am I punished for my childish impetuosity, in more than one instance : how thankful am I, that they are spared a greater shock — I trust in God, I may live to correct my faults, and amend my conduct."" Dr. Burton pressed his hand on the bed, but did not speak. *' We are all thankful, dear Frede- rick,"" said Lady Jerningham, "" for this happy change !""",matt,,
775,"The regular breathing of the sleeper, the ticking of a gold hunting-watch suspended at the head of the bed, and the crackling of the burning logs, were the only sounds that broke the stillness. "" I have no doubt you have been anxious, Lady Audley,-*^ Robert said, after a pause, fixing my lady's eyes as they wandered furtively to his face. '^ There is no one to whom my uncle's life can be of more value than to you. Your happiness, your prosperity, your safety depend alike upon his existence.'' The whisper in which he uttered these words was too low to reach the other side of the room where Alicia sat. Lucy Audley's eyes met those of the speaker with some gleam of triumph in their light. "" I know that,"" she said. '^",matt,,
780,"There was something, I say, pleasing in the countenance of the young man : his form was fine and athletic ; his manner of address gentle and agreeable; and so expressive was the eye that remained, that if he had had its fellow, I question whether jealousy might have permitted me to make the proposal which is contained in the next sentence. "" Harkee, young- man,"" said I, "" you seem willing to work for your wages, — 't is perhaps the same thing to you whether you work at sea or on land, or in one town or another : if you 're agreed to step on board with me, you shall have two double doubloons, and fare well, till I put you ashore at Alicante."" "" At Alicante ! "" repeated the young man in an agitated voice, the reason of which will become known by and by — "" to Alicante be it then, and God bless you for the offer;"" and thus I was provided with a servant. I must confess, that curiosity to know how the loss of an eye could be the ruin of a man, was as powerful a motive with me to engage his services, as either com- passion for his condition, or my own necessities. Before doubling Cape tie Gata, I had found some occasion for the services of an attendant, who, as it will afterwards be seen, had too much experience of the sea, to be incommoded by the white swell against which we were forced to beat all the way from Malaga; but having once rounded this cape, we ran directly for Cartha- gena, in which port we cast anchor on the fourth day. Here, although our stay was short, I did not forget the new character under which I travelled ; and in that character, contrived to get quit of some few of my pieces. I was equally charmed with the Carthagena women, and the Balsapintada wine ; weakness being the characteristic of the one, and strength of the other.",matt,,
785,"It was eighteen months since Janet Hermann had drawn her allowance. Her husband once had written in her name, saying that she was ill, but Mr. Wakefield had sent an order payable only on her signature, and it had never been acknowledged or presented ! Could Janet be living ? Or could she be in some such fitful state of prosperity as to be able to disregard 25/. .^ H€r mother spent many anxious thoughts and prayers on her, though the younger ones seemed to have almost forgotten her, so long it was since she had been a part of their family life.

790,"You will want a certificate T He pauses, looking at Garden in his clear, uncompromising fashion. ' Yes,' says Garden hurriedly. * But there is no time now ; I must go.' He makes a step towards the staircase. The surgeon lays his hand upon his arm. * Your address, at least/ says he, a little sternly. Garden drags a card from his pocket and gives it to him, wrenching his arm free at the same time. '",matt,,
795,"Nothing at first was directly addressed to me, so I took no part in it. The good rector came out with really some tolerably eloquent discoursing; and the poor ladies drank up his words; oh, you should have seen them. I fancy the fair fiancée drank a little too much of them, and got rather spiritually intoxicated—at least I hope she did—as some excuse for her. As he went rolling on for an hour or more, he described the world as grinding between the nether millstone of Popery and the upper millstone of Infidelity, and yet a universal millennium was very near indeed through this Bible activity. At the end he turned sharp upon me. Of course Mr. Sutherland would feel it his duty to take the chair on so truly blessed an occasion? Now, conceive societies, with chairmen, dragging at the poor world from between two such millstones!!",matt,,
800,"He felt nearer happiness than he had felt since that fatal night. In the first place, it was an infinite relief to be away from the scene of his crime ; and in the second place, there was a world of comfort in being associated with the one woman whose influence could at once soothe and strengthen — the one woman who knew his ghastly secret,, yet had not turned from him with loathing. He could never forget that kiss upon his fore- head which had assured him of a woman's pitying love. He had taken no base advantage of that sign of tenderness ; he had not pressed his suit with the vehemence of a passion that will take no denial. He had been humble with her, as became him in the abasement of his guilt. And he was happier now, toiling for her, than he could have hoped to be. He laboured at his task all the morning, one of the sisters working with him on the inner side of the windows ; and the general result was an increase of brightness which seemed like the forerunner of spring.",matt,,
805,"come up at once for consulta- tion."" The rest of the day the owner of the Clarion spent pleasantly on the river with ^NFrs. Lane and a party of ladies, including a young Duchess, who was pretty, literary, and socialistic. At night he went down to the Clarion office, and produced a leader on the position of affairs at Damesley whifli, to the practised eye, contained one paragraph — but one only — wherein the dawn of a new policy might have been discerned. Xaturally the juxtaposition of events at the moment gave him considerable anxiety. He knew very well that the Damesley bargain could not be kept waiting. The masters were losing heavily every day, and w^ere not likely to let him postpone the execution of his part of the contract for a fortnight or so to suit his own convenience. It was like the sale of an "" old master.""",matt,,
810,"This was very different from arriving, as she had done, at Exeter, without a chance of making a single acquaintance besides her dress-maker. Moreover, she hail got through the difficulty of throwing off her weeds admi- rably; she had managed matters so that the dress of Agnes should be perfectly respectable, and yet cost her nothing for a twelvemonth ; she had just received a quarters income without any deduction, and, to. crown all, "" she never was iv better looks in her Use;"" Short, then, was the interval of discomfort that kept her inactive on first entering her lodgings. ""It was not quite such a drawing-room as that of Mrs. Peters, to be sure, but it was the most fashionable part of Clifton ; and with her man- agement, and admkable ways of contriving things, she should soon make it extremely lady -like."" "" Well, now then wc must set to work, Agnes,"" .... she said, drawing off her gloves. "" Come, Jerningham, you must not stand looking out of the window, child ; there is an im- mense deal to do before wc can be comfortable. And the first thing will be to get all the trunks up, those, that came by the waggon, and those that came with us."" """,matt,,
815,"My better stars ordained that^ before I made a final choice^ I should apply to Gonzalez Texado, who enjoyed among the lawyers a high and well earned reputation. Texado plunged into the labyrinth with a courage worthy of a hero, he cleared up this chaos with a perseverance and knowledge approaching to a miracle ; and in six months the twenty law-suits were tried, and one only of very little consequence was lost, Texado, who was entirely regardless of his own affairs, used such care and method in mine, that I am indebted to his generous cares, to his / indefatigable indefatigable labours, for my father's whole estate free from all deductions* You must either allow, Signor, that in- gratitude is a virtue, or that it became ihe to seek every opportunity to prove to Texado that I was far from it. This is not the only circumstance which attached me to him. From frequently seeing him^ and consulting him on my affairs, I be- came so much enamoured of the society of this virtuous and enlightened man, that it became essential to my happiness. I never proceeded in any affair without his advice, and what he advised me to do always proved to be what I ought to have done; so that he has been literally the founder, the sole founder of my fortune ; and Signora Massarena cannot have for- gotten;, c6 gotten^ that it is to this good man we owe the happiness of our union.",matt,,

825,"Lucy was left standing, almost panting with anger, with the sense of defeat. and with detestation for Alice. The conver- sation had only lasted a few minutes ; it had not been loud, nor attracted any attention. People who intended going to Irkford by the coming express were beginning to drop in and stroll about the platform. Lucy, after a moment, forced herself to walk about — forced her face into an expression of something like composure. "" If he were stripped and lying in the gutter,"" she said to herself, or rather, the words seemed to go whirling round and round in her mind, so that she could hear and think of nothing else, *'she would lift him out and clothe him. Very well — I was sorry, but I'm not now.",matt,,
830,"So now listen ! I D D — a hope my wife wants none of your manage, and you are to hold your peace. After all, it is but surmise — most likely false. Casimir wrote to her — that's true enough — but, mind you, before I married her. Young men will be young men, but he is honour itself, and my friend."" ""A devil for women,"" moaned M'Causland. ""As to that,"" said his master, "" so was I.",matt,,
835,"My dear, he cannot perhaps read well enough to enjoy it ; find him an easy story book, and advise him to read it."" May selected a book that very afternoon, and asked Jesse if he could read that. "" Oh yes, I can read that,"" the boy replied scornfully. ""I've been to school;"" and he read half a page, evincing by constant stum- bling, and perfect indifference to stops, that schooling was not, as our French neighbours say, his forte. May was disgusted at so much ignorance, and speedily resolved to cure it. She did not ask her intended scholar whether she should instruct him or not, but with prompt decision swooped down upon him at once. "" You must read to me out of this book, Jesse.",matt,,
840,"Yes, there is something the matter, but nothing to alarm you — rather a cause for hope. Your sister has lost her evil angel — Mrs. Price has eloped."" "" Eloped !"" cried Effie. "" There was no obstacle to their marriage !"" "" You mistake me. She has fled from Gerard, not with him."" "" Tell me about it,"" said Effie, faintly.",matt,,
845,"I am doubly betrayed."" "" My gracious liege — "" "" Anjou is guilty of lezc-majeste and felony in the highest degree — and shall die the deatli of a traitor — as shall all who have favoured, or are engaged in this foul conspiracy — even though I flood the Louvre in the noblest blood of France. The scaffold and the block shall not be removed from these courts, nor shall the headsman cease his labour till he has utterly exterminated this hydra-headed monster of rebellion. Hitherto I have been easy, forgiving, merciful. It has availed nothing. Henceforth I will be relentless and inflexible. The ordinance of my ancestor Louis XL, which condemns hirn who is guilty of misprision of treason, to like doom with the traitor, is not yet abrogated.",matt,,
850,"Oh, do not forget that! for you know that that bit of paper from your own hand, is all belongin' to you we will ever see more. Avick machree, machree, many a long look--out we will have for it. It may keep the ould man's heart from breakin'."" She was silent, but, as she uttered the last words, there was a shaking of the voice, which gave clear proof of the difficulty with which she went through the solemn task of being calm, which, for the sake of her son, she had heroically imposed upon herself. She was now silent, but, as is usual with Irish women under the influence of sorrow, she rocked herself involuntary to and fro, whilst, with closed eyes, and hands clasped as before, she held communion with God, the only true source of comfort. ""Connor,"" she added, after a pause, during which he and Una, though silent from respect to her, were both deeply affected; ""sit fornint me, avick machree, that, for the short time you're to be with me, I may have you before my eyes.",matt,,
855,"Ah, Emma ! you never will credit the services which the fairies render me. Two of them, Emulation and Ap- plication, were singularly beneficial to me in my girlhood ; but listen while I explain the wonder. Our very kind neighbour, Mrs. James, was in early life an inmate in a nobleman's family, being the niece of Lady Arbury, and receiv- ing the same education with her daughters. She was entitled to enter- tain higher views ; but, preferring the chaplain to a dissipated man of rank, she became our vicar's wife. Hav- ing no children and much leisure, she kindly volunteered her services to teach me and two or three of my playfellows g 6 the rudiments of polite education. We attended her when she was not better occupied, and as instruction was at once a favour and a rarity, it was dearly prized.",matt,,
860,"It was generally understood that he could do so, but it was by no means certain ; and a general knowledge of things, in which might be included the odds at hazard or on the Derby favourite, and a tolerably correct taste for Sneyd s claret, was all that was demanded at the hands of a soldier in those days. And here, nurse ! let me not plunge into the intricacies of the new system, lest I forget the very existence of the "" now professional dealer."" Let me not lift the mysterious veil which shrouds a ten-fold ignorance under flimsy coats of cramming : that sends into the service, day after day, the most unlicked, ill-educated, badly dressed, undisciplined staff of subalterns, whose delight is in a black pipe, and whose glory and hands are in their Zouave breeches pockets. There was something honest and dignified in the undisguised ignorance of Dick Crupperton, and a few such as he ; but the passing of an examination in the elements of everything, with a real knowledge of nothing, is a miserable subterfuge for the profoundest in- capacity. Well, our Dick got his cornetcy long enough before these piping times, and a very cheerful cornet was he. He helped to keep the regiment alive, drove the reoimental team, hunted the reo^i- mental drag, drank the regimental claret, and led a far from miserable life of it.",matt,,
865,"A fruit-tart tempted them, and with wine they managed to dispose of it between them. It must be remembered that they had made a very early breakfast, and that it was four o'clock before they sat down to their dinner. ' Adele will get my letter about tea-time,' said Philip. ' How I wish I was with her ! ' Allen said nothing. Every word Philip uttered that reminded him of Adele struck him like a clagger-thrust. HeAvas less strong than he imagined. They waited patiently, they knew not for what, only both seemed to expect some- thing.",matt,,
870,"“Any body would have thought so indeed. There will be very few people in the Pump-room, if it rains all the morning. I hope Mr. Allen will put on his great coat when he goes, but I dare say he will not, for he had rather do any thing in the world than walk out in a great coat; I wonder he should dislike it, it must be so comfortable.” The rain continued—fast, though not heavy. Catherine went every five minutes to the clock, threatening on each return that, if it still kept on raining another five minutes, she would give up the matter as hopeless. The clock struck twelve, and it still rained.— “You will not be able to go, my dear.”",matt,,
875,"Altogether the room was as dainty as the lover could make it, and its contiguity to the perfumery in the shop filled it with a composite and delectable aroma, and completed its bower-like character. The appearance of the only occupant of the pretty room was scarcely in keeping with its attractions. This was a coarsely built man, with a face reddened, it might be, by constant exposure to sun and wind, and whose ear-rings were not seen to much advantage amid the mass of long, black hair that tangled around his head. The expression of his features Avas not exactly ferocious, but it was stern and forbidding, and a smile which disclosed an array of formidably strong wliite teeth did not extend itself to liis keen dark eyes. His hands were red and muscular, and a coloured shirt, secured at the throat by a ribbon and ring, was surmounted by no collar, and showed a powerful bull neck, one that might have belonged to a gladiator of the old days. The guest's figure was broad, and, as far as could be seen, for he did not rise from his lounging position on a low chair, he appeared to be under the middle height, a disad- vantage apparently more than compensated for in his large and powerful limbs. Coarsely, rather than carelessly dressed, it would have been hard to assign him a profession, though perhaps his general bearing, and some mystic signs that had been traced with gunpowder on the backs of his hands, might suggest the impression that he had some connection with sea-service.

880,"He was no sooner defeated on one point, than he took refug-e in another— he denied every particle of evidence in toto, so that many of Mr. Mag-g-s' witnesses stood fair chances of committal for wilful perjury. All was of no avail, however, and when Mr. Nettlecraft, the London lawyer he had en- LIBRARY UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOI^ g'ag'ed^ waited on him one morning* at Armi- tag-e^ and formally begg-ed to resig-n any further steps in a case which he saw would eventually ruin, and brand his client with disg-race, Mr. Crofton felt as a very savag-e- ly inclined tig'er mig-ht be supposed to feel, on finding- himself enclosed in the strong- meshes of a net spread for him even in his own den, from whence it was no long'er possi- ble to keep the hunters at bay. Should he turn his envenomed fury against himself and deprive them of the triumph of taking- him alive ; or must he come forth crest-fallen, and humble and sue for the mercy of his vanquishers ? One only little ray of hope was there for him.",matt,,
885,"It appeared, from his own account, that he had been suffering extremely from his dreadful dream, on occasion of the visit of some young stranger — an English- man, I think.' "" * Myself, I have no doubt,' said I. "" ' Probably,' returned the prior ; ' and this was either the cause, or the consequence c 2 of his illness, for it is difficult to decide which.' "" ' But how came he here ?' I in- quired. "" * It was in this monastery he commenced his vocation/ answered the padre. ' He was only at Pierre Chatel by indulgence, and after this accident they did not wish to retain him.' "" ' I do not wonder at that, I am sure,' said I. "" But why did he deny having been there ?

A shout of laughter : the boys' satisfac- tion had grown irrepressible. Sir Simon laughed with them.

895,"The servant put the lute into Tito's hands, and then said something in an under-tone to his master. A little subdued questioning and answering went on between them, while Tito touched the lute in a preluding way to the strain of the chorus, and there was a confusion of speech and muscial humming all round the table. Berbardo Rucellai had said, “Wait a moment, Meleme;” but the words had been unheard by Tito, who was leaning towards Pucci, and singing low to him the phrases of the Mænad-chorus. He noticed nothing until the buzz round the table suddenly ceased, and the notes of his own voice, with its soft low-toned triumph, “Evoè, evoè!” fell in startling isolation. It was a strange moment. Baldassarre had moved round the table till he was opposite Tito, and as the hum ceased there might be seen for an instant Baldassarre's fierce dark eyes bent on Tito's bright smiling unconsciousness, while the low notes of triumph dropped from his lips into the silence.",matt,,
900,"I asked eagerly whether she had received an answer from Miss Young, and to what effect. Lucy, with a glowing face, pro- VOL. Ill, C duced lior friend's little note, sent in im- mediate answer. ""Dearest Lucy, "" You are the best good friend in the world ; but I can't write on some subjects. We have all much to forgive, and I have been very wicked and very un- happy.

905,"He also observed that had the Mohawks been less eager to seize upon these trophies of victory, they would not have destroyed all their enemies upon the spot, and might now have been in possession of many prisoners. Brandt acquiesced in the propriety of these remarks, and the captives of Butler were permitted to remain solely at his own disposal. During the carousal, or, as the Indians termed it, the Feast of Victory, on this occasion, every species of riot and debauchery was indulged in to excess. To describe a scene of such frantic folly and disgusting dissipation, would be to give a representation of human depravity and degradation, neither agreeable to write nor desirable to read. While in a state of intoxication, an altercation, as was to have been expected, took place between some of the Indians and the tories, which the interference of their chiefs alone prevented from becoming serious and bloody. In consequence of this, it was agreed by Butler and Brandt, that, while the Indians remained in the Valley, they should encamp at a distance from the tories, but not so far off as to prevent the maintenance of friendly intercourse, or a speedy junction in case of either being attacked by an enemy. On visiting Agnes the next day, Butler approached her with the self-satisfied air of a wooer who thinks he can plead the merit of having performed an action of a nature very pleasing to his mistress.",matt,,
910,"Flora's grief was, however, too deeply rooted for being removed by all the kind-hearted attentions which Mary could bestow ; and her internal suffering was soon diverted, — it could not be aug- mented, — by annoyances from without. Finding that Mac Skinner, sen. had been so successful in recovering the amount of the former wadset from Glenmore, several of the most vindic- tive of his creditors thought the letting loose of that personage upon his daughter, in the spring-tide of her sorrow, might be the means of squeezing all that was squeezable out of the estate. It may easily be con- ceived, that this scheme was very eagerly relished by the wily doer j and, in order to render the measures he might pursue more efficient, he pre- vailed upon all the creditors of the chief, of whom he could obtain know- ledge, to assign their bonds, bills, and obligations against the chief; in order that he, the holder, might sue for the joint behoof. The precarious condition of the Glenmore estate, and the inroads of wadsets and annual rents, induced the creditors to execute a most absolute assignation in favour of old Mac Skinner ; and no sooner was he armed with this deed, than he com- menced operations. The ultimate object of Mac Skinner, in taking this trouble, for the behoof of Glenmore's creditors, (for that was his ostensible object,) was one of very deep and crafty purpose : It was this : to possess himself, or rather his hope- ful heir, the partner of Mac Fleecer, of the estate and honours of Glenmore ; to procure for the said heir the hand of Flora, which was, indeed, a sine qua non in the business ; and then turning round upon the creditors, to whom he had taken care to give no back bond, to set them and their claims at defiance ; and thus raise his family to the first rank in the Highlands, without any other price than a reasonable portion of legal villainy.",matt,,
915,"I should like to be about in fields, and quiet places. So I've been thinking Henry might be sent away, and I might take the management of the farm. I should like so much to see the fields again. Are they green yet, father ? And the copse where the primroses grow, how bright they used to look, like stars peeping out. And the violets that I used to gather for my mother. I wonder whether the bank is covered with them now?""",matt,,
920,"It would be wrong to say that the question did not startle him ; but, after the first strange shock of such an address, an impulse of response and sympathy filled his mind. It might have been difficult to get into ac- quaintance by means of the chit-chat of society, which requires a certain initiation ; but such a grand subject was common ground. He answered as very few of the people interrogated by the sick man did answer. He did not show either alarm or horror — he started slightly, it is true, but he answered without much hesitation : "" Yes, I have thought often of death,"" said Colin. Though he was only a second-class passenger, this was a question which put all on an equality ; and now it was not difficult to under- stand why the captain eschewed his troublesome questioner, and how the people looked embarrassed to whom he spoke. ""Ah, I am glad to hear such an answer,"" said the stranger; "" so few people can say so.",matt,,
925,"The savages accepted them. But as soon as they came down, r'r'r, the same as before — the men were killed — ^just knocked on the head, so, before the w^omen's eyes ; and the women were stripped of their very clothes, and handed over, in I dare not tell you what shameful condition, to the tender mercies of those savaere brutes there. That's what ^ve o may expect, if Hippolyte's fool enough to listen to terms. But I hope he won't. For my part, I'd sooner die first, with my tongue in my cheek, flinging a curse with my last good breath against those dogs of savages.' With such cheering conversation the night wore through and the morning dawned upon their weary eyelids. More and more Kabyles seemed to burst upon them for ever.",matt,,

935,"An unri- valled exploit turned out to be a happy conjecture — a marvellous deed was the lion's skin that covered the ears of a new- reading. I was confounded to hear the same epithets applied to their obscure de- migods, that I associated with the names of Csesar and Socrates, and Pericles and Cicero. It was perplexing to find that Pharsalia or a Philippic — the groves of Academus or the fanes of the Acropolis, could receive no higher admiration than was lavished upon the unknown exploits of a hunter after syllables. After my battle^ I was never annoyed by my former friends. As time advanced, I slightly relaxed in my behaviour, and, when it was necessary, we interchanged words, but I never associated with any one. I was however no longer molested.",matt,,

Aod, as an Englishman, he would have a right to be listened to. English officials are not like American, the natural vassals of their countrymen ; but still, when a man is at his wit's end, there is something in the idea that a person of authority, in whom he has a vested interest, is within reach, v, hich is consolatory. To be introduced to this functionary, however, by Paolo, whose position did not seem to be very important, did not please Harry's pride. He sent the little fellow away with a vague promise of thinking of it, which disap- pointed the friendly little man. Paolo could not restrain his anxious desire to be of use.

960,"Many of the towns along the west coast had been attacked, the soldiers of the Republic being either driven out or massacred, and the people restored to liberty and their ancient laws. Unassisted, the Genoese found it impos- sible to resist the determined attacks of the islanders; the war was, therefore, carried on, on both sides, with unrelenting animosity and cruelty. A large number of the Genoese nobility and gentry inhabited the town of Bastia, who were terribly alarmed at the state of things throughout the island. One of these noblemen, Phillippo Carignano, was at this period gover- nor of Corsica. He was of a high, but impoverished family, and had accepted the dan gerous post at a time when there appeared every probability that the power of Genoa, over this ill-treated island, was drawing to its close. The Marchese de Carignano was a widower and advanced in life; his family consisted of a son and daughter. It was to the interest of the nobles to promote dissensions, which they turned to good account, by either confiscating the estates of the islanders, or condemning them to pay enormous fines, which went chiefly into the governor's or commissary - general's private coffers.",matt,,

975,"AN HEIRESS. THEL PERCIVAL CARTON, cousin to Imogen Rhys, heiress to very great wealth, and pos- sessor of more splendid jewels than any other spinster in the kingdom, must have a chapter of introduction all to herself, since she is obviously a personage of too much consequence to be brought into a story in the casual sort of manner that does very well for girls with nothing worth mentioning a year. The precise amount of her heiress-ship was not kndwn definitely, but it was popularly estimated as being somewhere between eighty thousand and a hundred and twenty thousand a-year ; for when people talk of sums of that magnitude they are apt to become vague, and to regard twenty thousand pounds, more or less, as the merest trifle. She was an only child, and had inherited from her parents, who were both dead, a very large fortune. And besides this she was the chosen in- heritor of Mr Carton, her father's brother, who was a childless old widower of im- mense property, and with whom she lived at Carton House. A Mrs Grey, who was a poor relation of the family, also resided there, and officiated as her chaperon ; but as Mrs Grey was a nonentity, and as Mr Carton hardly ever interfered with his niece, Ethel w^as virtually mistress of the place, and did pretty much what she liked with herself and every one and thing con- nected therewith. The affairs of an heiress are of course far more worthy of attention than those of an ordinary young woman who has nothing to recommend her except her own merits, and therefore the world at large had always taken a lively interest in Ethel and what- ever concerned her.",matt,,

However, he had no doubt of success ; any woman would pause twice, he considered, before committing the egregious mistake of giving a refusal to the offer of his hand — any woman of sense, that is, who was gifted with sufficient discernment to be able to appreciate both himself and his position ; and Miss Myles was a person capable of such discrimination.

Through- out the whole day, Susan appeared the same penitent creature ; and continued the same modest behaviour as when she first entered the court. Three several times her child was brought to her to be suckled. Many have supposed, that this was planned by some pity- ing friend, to work upon the sympathy of her judges. I am, however, persuaded, that it was entirely in accordance with her own request, and arising from a very different motive. It has been stated, that she looked upon her child, at its birth, with a horror approaching to desperation ; but that, after some time, she became more gentle, and resolved to act the part of a kind mother to it. And, as it was the first and chief witness to her having fallen into a state of deadly sin, to have it as much as possible in her presence, that she might thereby be reminded of the dreadful situation in which she stood both in the eyes of God and man.",matt,,

Bat somehow, when she had done justice to these delicacies, bodily and mental, she began to fidget about the clock in a manner that puzzled Mrs. Darkley, who knew that she had had on more than one previous occasion to give Susanna a hint that it was time to go, before the idea of going was at all accepted by that young lady.

The shock had struck at all the delicacies of her nature, and made her sick of the life in which such thoughts could be. And her contemplative nature, her visionary heart had taken refuo;e in heaven. Isabel's trial and her struggle were less — the circumstances were dif- ferent. Instead of the Captain to vociferate against her suitor and reproach her if she looked sad, she had soft, compassionate silence all around her, everybody sympathising with her, no one asking what her sorrow was. Margaret had been sur- rounded by a closer domestic group; first, the Captain, loud and rough and peremptory, inca- pable of comprehending any scruple of her deli- cate mind; then Jean, not yet sufficiently mel- lowed, by love to understand the visionary girl ; and Isabel was still too young, too foolish and heedless to have one sigh of the breaking heart breathed into her bosom.",matt,,

Tired with his long journey, he slept soundly at first, until disturbed by a disagreeable sensation, which, without awaken- ing him, destroyed the comfort of his repose. Oppressed as if by a painful dream, he lay uneasily on his couch of straw, but again and again the same sensation returned, and he moved restlessly from side to side, as though striving with some unseen power. Still he did not awake, until at length, yielding as it were to a sudden and irre- sistible impulse, he started from 'his sleep, and raising himself upon his couch, gazed around him. And there, in the dim moonlight, ere his senses had found their tone, his excited imagination painted innumerable phantoms ; but all bore the same form — the form of his mysterious fellow-travellers.

1235,"The contraction of the muscle straitens and compresses the blood-vessels, and forces the blood with impetuosity through the heart ; and this squeezing or propelling force gives the fluid an im- petus, that makes it return with violence upon the muscles, in the course of its circulation; then by force and impulse, it stretches the transverse and spiral nervous fibres, and so extends the contracted muscle, that drove it by contraction from itself. Upon this, the blood-vessels having obtained their due extent and capacity, the distending force of the blood of consequence ceases : but the moment it does, the contractive power of the nerves begins to act again, and restores them to a contracted dense state, by a force exactly equal to that which ex- tended them ; till the returning propelled blood re- enters the muscle, and stretches it again, as before described. Such are the two wonderful counter- forces that produce the natural involuntary motion of the heart, and carry on the circulation of the blood. You see with your eyes, in the opened live dog this alternate contraction and extension ; and as the stretching power is but a consequence of the contracting power, contraction is the spring of this wonderful action, in which our will or free agency has no concern. And to what shall we ascribe this astonishing operation, this amazing contractive power, so exactly as to time, and so constantly con- tinued on the muscles of natural or necessary mo- tion; till the aequilibrium by some means or other be broken, and the motion is preternaturally inter- rupted and suspended ?
