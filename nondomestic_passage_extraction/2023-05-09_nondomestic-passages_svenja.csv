759,"They knew not the pangs of blighted affection ; or if Lady Caroline had indeed known them, as we have been taught, she suspected not that they were the cause of her daughter's suffer- ings, and she was forced to see her pine and linger. Oh why have we hearts, if they are to be thus broken ? why are we endowed with feelings of such exquisite sensibility, if they are to be the mock of fortune, and the butt for all the shafts of disappointment and deception ; to be trampled 'l!rpJft%ithout thoug-ht by those for whom we ^ftft^e^ Mce ' felt that the sacrifice of existence would be but a light task ? And light, indeed, would it be, compared with the length of bitter years we have to drag on our heavy, heavy ^(ihain. - flaaaoiq Ji ausntjiiio.",svenja,,
764,"The eastern side, which is peculiarly rough and rugged, was formerly the chief seat of Macgregor and his clan. Occu- pying a district almost inaccessible, when roads were unknown and the country more wooded, the Macgregors were enabled to carry on a cruel as well as a predatory system of warfare on the surrounding clans; forcing contribu- tions under the title of "" black mail/""' But it would be vain to attempt to describe scenes, fitted only for the one pen, or the artist's pencil, and which can hardly bear to be tamed into description. The wanderers scarcely spoke to each other, so charmed were they by the air of stillness and solemnity around them : their dreamy as- sociations were not materialised by any thoughts of busy every-day life ; they felt the poetry, which external nature in the hour of twilight majestically creates! "" I love thee, twilight! as thy shadows roll, The calm of evening steals upon the soul ; Sublimely tender, solemnly serene, Still as the hour, enchanting as the scene ! Twilight I love thee, — let thy glooms increase Till every feeling, — every pulse — is peace!"" At the time of which we write, steamboats were not to be seen, as now they are, — daily plying, freio-hted with human loads from the land of Cockayne, all flaunting in tartans — which they confound with plaids, — while the citizen from Tooley Street '' wd' his fat wame"" in a short Hieland coat, and his puir short houghs gartered below the knee, like a "" lang legged gilly,"" surprises the North.",svenja,,

774,"That 's Miss Wallis's,"" said the old lady on the first occasion. "" It is only that the blinds are down"" — meaning to say, ""I don't see the shutters up."" "" She is very old ; her doctor is paid by the year ; and her companion knows she will never find another such a place. This shows how much longer than they do doctors and nurses could keep people alive, if they had only a mind to it. A strange world is this ! Her money is not a bit of good to her, and might be so — pleasant — to any one else."" Even Hannah began to catch the money fever.",svenja,,
779,"I no sooner found myself alone, than all I the horrors returned upon me, which are to a certain degree almost always suspend- iiv ed, when man stands in the presence of his fellow-c feature. I traversed the walk in which Penruddock had left me with a rapid pace ; I beat myself with my clenched fist upon my forehead. It was no doubt early ^ays, for me to break off all commerce with my kind, and to shut myself out from human life. But so I was constituted ; such was the effect that this incident pro* duced upon me. I felt that the d©or of manly existence had just been opened up- on me, that I had been permitted for a mo- ment to contemplate prospects that appear- ed to me delicious and rapturous (for what sensation exists more rapturous, than that which a young man experiences, when he feels for the first time, that he is counted for something substantive in the dramatis persoYKje of society, that his voice is number. ed, that his opinion is listened to, that some eyes are turned upon him to remark the part he shall act ?) — and that then the door was suddenly and violently clapped in my face* I was left alone, in the narrow line between being and no-being ; the impene- trable door of exclusion, framed of the most hardened and the thickest oak, clamped with iron, and thick studded with the larg- est nails, before me, and the precipice of annihilation behind me. I had not an inch • of ground to stand on.",svenja,,
784,"Believing that this confession would prove a salutary mecicine to fhe disordered mind of the aim f)st dying siifferer, 'Sidney, with a ten- der preparatory speech, gave him the pa- per ; but what was his aitonishmcnt, when Philip, tearing it to atoms, strewed the floor wi:h the fragments, as he accused him of forging it. This precious paper, which might have mitigated the sentence of the law, was thus placed bevond recall; time was no longer permitted foi^ discussion ; and' the now passive youth was placed between his his two sentinels, as their machine drew off, and w^as followed by that which contained his desponding, wretched friend. As his young companion was placed be- yond his reach, the wretchfd Maitland re- turned to his hotel, there to deliberate on what steps he should pursue ; but great was his surprise to find a letter waiting his arri- val, from Donna Henrietta, requesting an immediate interview, upon a matter of the last importance. Aware of the intimacy which had subsisted between her and The- resa, he hesitated not a moment in instantly complying with the invitation. His recep- tion was politely cold ; but too miserable for observation, he intreated the promised communication, as he conceived it could only relate to the recent event which had taken place. Henrietta, aware of all circumstances con- nected with her victim from her English friends, was prepared in every w^ay for her attack; she expatiated on what he already knew of the penalty incurred by Philip, and and the heinousness of the crime for which he stood fully committed, of the nun in question having actually left the Portu- guese dominions, and had been assisted thereto by the verv man now in custody : she harrowed up his soul by painting the agonies of his parents, when the knowledge of this event should reach them ; then added — '' And what account can you, Mr. Mait- land, offer of your vigilance of this pre- cious charge committed to your care, this idol of your benefactors, this being, in whose welfare the very existence of your early friends is wrapt ?",svenja,,
789,"Lady Sydney, of Sydney Pleasance ! why what is she to you i^"" *' My uncle's wife,"" replied Rosalind, with dignity. "" I asked,"" observed Margaret, as if consci- ous that the abruptness of the question de- manded some apology, '* because my brother's chosen friend is Captain Basil Sydney."" "" He is with his friend then,'' said Rosalind with great naivete^ ""for I know they arrived yes- terday at Sydney Pleasance.",svenja,,
794,"Well,"" he replied, looking intently at his seal, before pressing it down, ^' I would not advise any friend of yours to run the risk on the chance."" "" Is it, then, so very difficult in the case of a poor clerk, exposed to temptation, not only from poverty, but from seeing his employers dishonest themselves ? I would not say a word if it were one of them — men comparatively rich, with respectable characters, and yet all the while guilty of fraud — but this is such a pitiable case. Can anything be done ?"" Mr. Martock could give no opinion on a case whereof he knew nothing. The usual way, he believed, was to memorialise the Home Secre- tary.",svenja,,
799,"III. H 'but heaven forbid, my dear friend, that you should remain unblest by the society of a virtuous and beautiful woman, on whom your choice would confer the extreme of happiness, and connected with whom far different pros- pects than those which you have menti- oned would open to your view. Oh ! that you would permit me the joy of beholding your felicity, otherwise mine must always remain incomplete/ and Pamela's name escaped my lips. I re- mained for some moments silent and confused, anxiously waiting his re- ply, yet afraid of hearing it, lest it should destroy my hopes. De Ver- neuil continued leaning against the balcony at which we stood, his eyes fixed on the landscape before us, while his mind appeared preoccupied and lost in a reverie. I ventured to renew the conversation, and expatiated on Pamela's merits, reverting at the lame time to the entire similarity which existed between us.",svenja,,
804,"Why, it's my ewer, my favourite ewer, and it's all smashed to bits, and I never can match it. You careless, clumsy, good- for-nothing creature ! "" "" Please, Selina,"" whispered her distressed elder sister. "" Very well, Johanna ; you are the mis- tress, I suppose? why don't you speak to your servant ? "" Miss Leaf, in an humbled, alarmed way, first satisfied herself that no bodily injury had been sustained by Elizabeth, and then asked her how this disaster had happened — for a serious disaster she felt it was. Not only was the present loss annoying, but a servant with a talent for crockery- breaking would be a far too expensive luxury for them to think of retaining.",svenja,,
809,"He was always virtuous, humane, and honourable.” “Is her father not an outlaw for murder?” “No, sir!” “And what is he?” “His name is Sir Francis Hamilton.” “What! he who came here to-day with you, and whom his excellency esteems so much?”",svenja,,
814,"cried Mr. Chester, lazily filling his glass again, and pulling out his toothpick. “Not at all. I like Ned too—or, as you say, love him—that's the word among such near relations. I'm very fond of Ned. He's an amazingly good fellow, and a handsome fellow—foolish and weak as yet; that's all. But the thing is, Haredale—for I'll be very frank, as I told you I would at first—independently of any dislike that you and I might have to being related to each other, and independently of the religious differences between us—and damn it, that's important—I couldn't afford a match of this description. Ned and I couldn't do it.",svenja,,
819,"Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!” with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat. Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed Tellson's. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him: “What is it, brother?",svenja,,
824,"“I don't pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic,” said Lydgate. “His position is not quite like that of the Apostles: he is only a parson among parishioners whose lives he has to try and make better. Practically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an impatience of everything in which the parson doesn't cut the principal figure. I see something of that in Mr Tyke at the Hospital: a good deal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people uncomfortably aware of him. Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick! —he ought to think, as St Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the birds.”",svenja,,
829,"For a few seconds the heavy waves rolled over Reginald Lisle's head ; but then he rose, and instantly, without knowing or willing it, struck out with strength and skill. He was an expert and practised swim- mer; and the impulse was not to be resisted. Ere he had swam half a dozen yards, and before he had fully recovered thought, his hand struck against something hard. It was a hen-coop, and he clutched it tight. It rolled round with his weight ; but he held fast, and soon found means to make it serviceable. Unty- ing his cravat, he contrived to bind himself to it in such a manner as to keep his head and shoulders above water, without spending his strength in any farther exertion than was necessary to prevent the coop from being rolled over by the waves. But the sea, as I have said, was not rough, and such small objects as the man and the frail woodwork that sup- ported him, were raised upon the bosom of the long swell, hardly feeling it.",svenja,,
834,"Her every thought was of him ; her tears, her sighs, her sobs, were loud and audible, with every symptom of deep despondency. Her prayers to the Almighty were frequent, in behalf of his soul, and that she might soon partake of the heavenly bliss with her deceased lord, there to be again united, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. At this period of her lamentations, the term of which precisely I am not acquainted with, but, as far as we can con- jecture, may have been some five or six years, the lady had not lost the freshness of her beauty, nor had the morning of her days entirely flitted away. Her countenance would sometimes beam forth rays of cheerfulness, even as Aurora gladdens the eastern sky on a fine summer's morning. The portals of her eyes, the lashes of which were the finest that mortals ever beheld, inspired emo- tion within the breast, especially when they flowed forth in tears like showers in an April day ; and her voice was so soft, that it was as the southern breezes wafting the perfumes of Am- brosia. Her breathing was, in her lover's ima- gination, as the zephyrs fanning the woodbine leaves, and in fragrance resembled the nectar's balmy juice, that the industrious bees oft mistook them for Flora's beauteous rose. Her hands were as lilies of the valley ; and, gentlemen of the jury, to finish all her perfections in one word, her bosom was as white as snow, at least in the imagi- nation of that youthful lover, who is now arraigned for assault and battery upon this same beautiful lady of his acquaintance, and for which he now stands to be heard in his defence at your bar.",svenja,,
839,"They have been taught it by those who don't love you. It is because you endeavour to keep the people within bounds, that these villains, who are trying to ruin them by luring them into rebellion, have industriously labour- ed to make you suspected. You, and Cobbett, and Sir Francis, and the Major are all re- presented as but Tories in disguise, doing the work of the ministers, by keeping them quiet till they are all dead with starvation."" "" The miscreants ! "" ejaculated Philip ; '' but I cannot believe that things are so bad, so abruptly changed. I must go and see for myself."" *^ For heaven's sake,"" said Lawrence, ""don't be so rash.",svenja,,
844,"I thought he could never pass unnoticed. If you had said he was haughty, or contemptuous "" '' But I don't think he is at all. He looks a little proud, perhaps, but I think it is only because he is so tall and slender. I am sure he was quite condescending to talk to me."" "" I believe you like him a little after all."" There was a touch of vexation in Charlotte's voice. "" I don't dislike him. And then, he is Horace's friend, and he saved his life ; uncle told me all about it the day after I came.""",svenja,,
849,"George was amiable and rational, but even he knew not how to keep within bounds, where money was the question ; yet Mr. Cooper would willingly have given him his daughter, who was kept in Hanover-square as a sort of guard over the property, on which Mr. Cooper had a claim of five thousand pounds; this, with an additional ten, he would cheerfully have given with his daughter to George ; but George could not forget the elegant, tender object of his first affections so much, as to replace her by the good-heart- ed, vulgar daughter of his wine-merchant. — "" No,"" said he to Augusta, "" I could do without wine, or make any sacrifice to pay the five thousand pounds, except the one required ; but to sacrifice taste, sentiment, and and affection, and to barter independence for a maintenance, is too much !"" It is however a query whether George would have been equal to a sacrifice of any kind, had it come to the point. We are all creatures of habit and education, and both habit and education with George spoke only of indulgence. While lady Emilia and captain Greaves kept the colonel in their power by gam- bling, sir Edward Hargrave, a worn-out disgusting debauchee, advanced at various times considerable sums to release him from difficulties, for which he took bonds ; but as Eleonora opened into beauty, and became renowned as a sparkler, the ba- ronet turned his eyes on her; and well aware that any dishonourable proposal would be deeply resented by all the proud family, he screwed up his courage to the pitch, and fairly offered himself and large property. Had it fortunately happened that Eleo- nora's heart had known no prepossession, it it is possible that vanity would have easily overcome repugnance ; but Eleonora loved and was beloved by an honourable, vir- tuous man.",svenja,,
854,"Not a looking-glass in the room — most uncawmonly extrWnary — pon my honour ! "" As he drawled out these words the door was hastily thrown open, but, instead of the expected clergyman, a tall, attenuated, sickly, and yet fierce-looking figure rushed into the vestry, and, fixing upon the bridegroom a look of blended wrath and exultation, shriek- ed out, "" Ha, villain ! have I caught thee ?"" At sight of this apparition the terrified Sir Dennis fled instantly through an opposite door, followed with huge strides by the infuriated stranger, who overtook him in the church, and, undeterred by the respect due to the place, seized him with his left hand, and began to horsewhip him most unmercifully, branding him, at the same time, with all sorts of oppro- brious epithets ; while his victim, who offered no resistance, in vain struggled to escape from his sinewy grasp. Struck aghast by this inex- plicable and appalling outrage, the bride sunk fainting into her mother's arms ; screams of affright burst from some of the females, while the others, following Sir Matthew and Lord Arthur, rushed forwards to inquire the cause of this atrocious outrage. On reaching the spot, they found Sir Dennis in the hands of two Bow Street officers, who forced manacles upon his wrists, hurried him into a hackney-coach that was in waiting, and immediately drove away !

859,"Why did you not tell me this before ? And what is it like.? A sort of conversazione, is it not ? '' "" There is a good deal of excellent and delight- ful conversation there, certainly."" "" Well, I '11 astonish them on the 16th ;— by the by, Sydenham, what do they say about me ? abuse me, perhaps ?"" "" Indeed, Beaumont, I have not yet happened to hear your name mentioned by any of the set."" "" Really !",svenja,,
864,"Na, my lord ; he canna lea' the cutter. The tide's risin, an' she's ower near the rocks."" ""Well, well; we shan't want lunch for an hour yet, so you can take your time."" "" But ye maun tak tent, my lord, hoo ye gang amo' the ruins. There's awkward kin' o' holes aboot thae vouts, an' jist whaur ye think there's nane. I dinna a'thegither like yer gaein' wantin' me."" "" Nonsense ! Go along,"" said the marquis.",svenja,,
869,"*^Yon should not have told that,"" said Delia, her face covered with blushes. '^ I wish particularly to know what Mrs. Snaith said."" ^^ It was rude, though."" '^No matter."" ^^ She said he was a shabby-looking little man, and had sloping shoulders."" Sir Samuel was wroth, and reddened. '* ""Well, what next ? "" he inquired. ** Deha whispered to her, * Mamsey, did you ever see our father ?",svenja,,
874,"Yet she never can be mine !"" Deep, deep and gloomy were his meditations after; and more than one hour passed by, ere he moved a single muscle ; till, at length, he heard a step, and a voice speaking without; and, starting up, he strove to clear his brow, brushing back the hair from his forehead, and looking grave, but not so sad. The key was turned in the door; and the next moment, two faces, which he knew well, presented themselves, those of Herbert and William Lovet. Herbert stayed not long. ""For the first time in life, Master Grey,"" he said, "" I have petitioned to be a gaoler; but I have so much to thank you for, that I might well undertake that office on your behalf, to soften, as much as possible, 3'our captivity, which will not be long, I trust. My thanks and my plans of all kinds must have greater room than I will now give to them, as your cousin is here to talk with you ; but I will see you again, ere the day be over, and, in the mean time, provide for your com- fort, as far as may be. So fare-you-well for the present ; and, shaking him warmly by the hand, he turned to Lovet, saying : """,svenja,,
879,"In a few moments my pain ceased; a drowsy, happy calm crept over me; I fell asleep. How long I remained in this state I know not, but when I woke I felt perfectly restored. My eyes opened upon a group of silent forms, seated around me in the gravity and quietude of Orientals —all more or less like the first stranger; the same mantling wings, the same fashion of garment, the same sphinx-like faces, with the deep dark eyes and red man's colour; above all, the same type of race—race akin to man's, but infinitely stronger of form and grander of aspect, and inspiring the same unutterable feeling of dread. Yet each countenance was mild and tranquil, and even kindly in its expression. And, strangely enough, it seemed to me that in this very calm and benignity consisted the secret of the dread which the countenances inspired. They seemed as void of the lines and shadows which care and sorrow, and passion and sin, leave upon the faces of men, as are the faces of sculptured gods, or as, in the eyes of Christian mourners, seem the peaceful brows of the dead. I felt a warm hand on my shoulder; it was the child's.",svenja,,
884,"They all laughed at this, and Sylvia pul- ling Ned's hair, promised to punish him yet more severely at some future period for the remark. "" You be off, sir ! "" says old Paul, mirthful, but with majesty, ""don't break in upon the interesting converse of myself and this gen- tleman upon high and noble topics, with any of your ribald jesting. Bring out the tumblers, Sylvia, my dear. Where was I, Mr. Rook ? Oh, I was saying,"" &c., &c. I think the articled clerk began to be a little bored. The conversation seemed to him to consist of incessant conundrums, without any answers.",svenja,,
889,"But that was impossible, for the time of the attack was one of profound peace. Finally, it had been alleged, in the course of the trial, that the prisoner was insane. Now, although it had sufficiently appeared from the evi- dence given that he was a man of extraor- dinary and various talents, still that was not impossible ; and, upon the whole, had some countenance from the style of his address — for defence he would not call it. However as no direct evidence had been called to that point, the jury would do well to leave it whoUv out of their considera- tion; they might be assured it would obtain whatever attention was due to it in another quarter. — Some indulgence was also due to the prisoner on the ground of his unhappy training in early life, though he had him- self refused to urge it with that view. This also might be considered elsewhere, but was not to influence their verdict.",svenja,,
894,"She strove to drive them from her with her out-stretched arms, and for a mo- ment stood upon the jutting rock, and felt she was alone. That moment was delicious, for her memory was gone. The. cold free air blew round her, and her swelling veins and throbbing temples enjoyed the strange luxury. When thought returned again, it came to her as it had done Ihose one-and-twenty years before. The interval was all forgotten. The same wild wish to feel the cooling wave, that urged her then to spring into its bosom, urged her now. But the strong hope of youth, which then restrained her, was now gone for ever.",svenja,,
899,"His wares, I fear, had been selected from the refuse of the market, and he and his barrow were in a state of dilapi- dated shabbiness that matched his stock in trade. But not so the wheels on which his barrow was supported. They were wheels of the most gorgeous description. The spokes and the circumference were painted of the most brilliant scarlet, and the entire nave was gilded so as to have tlie appearance of a solid mass of gold. It is impossible to imagine anything more bizarre than the effect of these magnificent wheels doing the work of carrying such an equipage. Nevertheless, the apparition seemed to attract very little attention in the crowded street. The grand scarlet and gilded wheels flamed along among the crowd of shabby men and shabby vehicles with their load of onions and cabbages, and scarcely anybody turned his head to stare at them.",svenja,,
904,"The mantle which she had hastily thrown around her, had also fallen from her shoulders, and revealed her bare neck and bosom, on which the cold moonlight streamed in an un- interrupted flood of light, leaving only a shadow here and there where her clustering tresses had fallen. Around her reigned a solemn silence, which was only broken by such sounds as seemed to make the air stiller- for the drowsy rustling of the foliage, as it swayed to and fro at intervals, and the far-off murmuring of the waters of the Glyme, came so subdued and softened, that it was like the *'hush"" of nature whispering the world to sleep. Even the deer moved along the moonlit glades like shadows, or fed on the dewy herbage without a sound ; and a night-hawk that was wheelinsj between the moon and the earth, seemed to proclaim by its startling shrieks, that all above was as silent as below. The silence was however suddenly broken by a herd of deer, rushing affrighted down the steep on which Rosamond slept: then came a rattling of arrows, some of them striking the boles of trees into which they stuck, quivered for a moment, then remained still. Others again pierced the flying herd, and brought their lofty antlers to the earth ; but not a human voice was heard, and so thickly was the spot carpeted with luxuriant grass, that the footsteps of the marauders were inaudible until they rushed down the green declivity to seize the fallen deer. At length the hauberks and steel head- pieces of the archers glanced brightly in the moonlight, as they descended the steep eminence on which the fair sleeper was seated ; and she was no sooner observed by the two foremost of the party, who were bearing off a dead buck, than they threw down their load, and pointing out the object of alarm to their com- panions, the whole group, amounting to at least half a score, fled as if Satan himself had been at their heels. On they rushed with a speed which was truly marvellous, considering the weight of their breast-pieces, and so closely together, that to use a phrase of the turf, a blanket would have VOL.",svenja,,
909,"The words spoke of shelter and care and tenderness, and as he said imploringlv. ' Will you come ? ' a sound escaj)ed her lips. She heard it in a dream, and knew she had said, ' Yes.' His kiss was not a dream ; it was a claim of possession from which she instinc- tively shrunk. As she felt it, she would have given much to withdraw from her word ; a vague dread of the new unknown world to which she had pledged herself passed like a shadow over her soul ; but the door opened again and her lover turned to tell Agnes, standing on the threshold, that Honor had promised to be his wife.

914,"How my soul shrinks from the cold, reckless being, who, in scorn of all I said, in mockery of all my griefs, which he affected to deplore, and in coarse, insolent contempt of an avowal which should at least have made him pause, if it did not at once put an end to his hopes, meanly seeks to gain his purely selfish ends through parental authority !

919,I know I am in some degree under the influence of a delusion —but does not this strong delusion prove that I myself “am of subtiler essence than the trodden clod:” these flights of the imagination point to futurity; I cannot banish them. Every cause in nature produces an effect; and am I an exception to the general rule? have I desires implanted in me only to make me miserable? will they never be gratified? shall I never be happy?

934,"This letter appeared to me vague, obscure, enigmatical. Unsatisfied, disappointed, I felt, I had little to hope—and, yet, had no distinct ground of fear. I brooded over it, I tortured its meaning into a hundred forms—I spake of it to my friend, but in general terms, in which she seemed to acquiesce: she appeared to have made a determination, not to enquire after what I was unwilling to disclose; she wholly confided both in my principles, and in those of her son: I was wounded by what, entangled in prejudice, I conceived to be a necessity for this reserve. Again I addressed the man, whose image, in the absence of all other impressions, I had suffered to gain in my mind this dangerous ascendency. “I, once more, take up my pen with a mind so full of thought, that I foresee I am about to trespass on your time and patience—yet, perhaps, to one who makes ‘the human heart his study,’ it may not be wholly uninteresting to trace a faithful delineation of the emotions and sentiments of an ingenuous, uncorrupted, mind—a mind formed by solitude, and habits of reflection, to some strength of character. “If to have been more guarded and reserved would have been more discreet, I have already forfeited all claim to this discretion—to affect it now, would be vain, and, by pursuing a middle course, I should resign the only advantage",svenja,,

By degrees he became gloomy and more reserv- ed ; his hand was tremulous, his cheeks colour- less, his look absent and distracted ; his eye wandering and unfixed, his sleep broken and disturbed, his appetite gone, his flesh wasted, and old age crept upon him before the time. Then reverses and losses thickened upon him, and then conscience grew powerless, and then dishonesty grew stronger and less scrupulous, and then detection followed, and exposure was feared, and wife and child were forgotten, and the poor man perished by his own hand. Strangers pitied the deserted mother and child ; the former needed not that pity long. She died, and her poor child wept upon the lifeless parent, and was left to the mercy of a wide world ; and she found many kind friends who spoke comfort to her, and as she had never been habituated to indolence and luxury, nor accustomed to a life of gaiety and thoughtless- ness, exertion, so far from being painful and humihating, became the means of diverting her mind from her sorrows, and of filling her thoughts pleasingly. Thus educated, she was useful as an instruc- tress of others from her habits of close attention ; and in one family, the family of a nobleman of high consideration, she had been for several years ; and so good was her understanding, and so graceful, pleasant, and gentle had been her demeanour, that the whole family loved her and esteemed her. They behaved towards her with so much consideration, that she scarcely felt her dependence ; and as she was by no means obtrusive, they addressed her and con- versed with her as an equal ; and she being so moved, and so gratified by their kindness, formed herself naturally to a manner of most gentle and beautiful politeness.",svenja,,

Some of the Count's servants, who had been standing near, had by this time made their way up to him, and with their help he cleared the space around, shouting to the dragoons who were striving to come up, and had not clearly seen the transaction which had taken place, ""Keep back, keep back! — I will answer for his life ! If you come up there will be blood- shed!"" In the mean time the young man had sprung upon his feet, his dress soiled by the fall, his face glowing like fire, and fury flashing from his eyes.

1184,"All knew what they had to expect. The administration of justice was entirely impartial, and the law was backed up by the whole force of genuine diggers. They knew full well — being, perhaps, the most intelligent, experienced, and, so to speak, cultured class of ottvriers in the world — that the strong arm of the law would only be weakened to the detriment of the whole society. As for petty mining thefts, the stealing of small articles of value, of wash-dirt or auriferous drift — these offences were so manifestly con- temptible as well as immoral, that the whole field, as one man, worked for the detection and apprehension of the offender, who had no more chance than a lurcher among a pack of hounds. There was no lynching, however, — the invari- able result of a weak executive. Once handed over to the ' secular arm,' all w^ere assured that justice would be done. Six months' imprison- ment, even in the case of the smallest value stolen, might be taken to be a sufficient deterrent penalty.",svenja,,

The child had never felt the gnawings of hunger ; the mother had been familiar with them of late. She took as much for herself as she dared, then folded up the small re- mainder, and thrust it under some dock- leaves out of sight, lest she should be tempted to eat more, and leave nothing for the supper that she knew not where to procure. She did not feel rested; a sense of her position seemed to fall upon her like a blow. Where should she go ? what should she do ?

It was from this incident and its consequences that De Mara gathered a hght which he deter- mined should aid him in his future course. He investigated the traits of disposition Madeline had displayed in this short conversation, and he thought he plainly perceived that, to attack her on the side of her vanity, was to insure success ; and that, by properly playing her wounded self- complacency against itself, he should make him- self more entirely master and comptroller of her heart than by any other means that could be adopted.",svenja,,
