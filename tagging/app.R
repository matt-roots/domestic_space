#####!!!!! start by entering these commands
#drive_deauth()
#drive_auth()

# #####TD
# -make tagger a dropdown menu DONE
# -then it will give you the sentences
# -have annotation guidelines on page
# -do fewer calls
# -t-f-NA-trash options
# -a second option for "is this mixed?"

# -will draw from a single spreadsheet with passages and two assigned taggers
# -then output results to a different single sheet where each row is a passage and a tag by one coder (so two times as many rows as the first sheet)


#a df that matches names to the Google Drive ids of the spreadsheet
