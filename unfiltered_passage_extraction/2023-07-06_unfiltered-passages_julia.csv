1,"And Lucy tripped down the path to the stile in the churchyard wall, her trim, well-built, and active figure looking very VOL. I. u pretty in the light of the moon, which had risen while they had been talking. "" You must be ready for your supper, Mr. Lancaster, after your journey,"" said Bertha, turning to him as soon as Miss Hathaway had left them ; "" I will go and see if my grand- mother is awake. And you would like to see your room ?"" "" I am in no hurry to move from this spot, Miss Donne.",julia,,
2,"Being of a miserly disposition, he took much pleasure in visiting the cave and viewing his accumulation. From the trunks of those going to California Mateo had often taken sums of money — ge- nerally in silver — with which the owners had not wished to be encumbered, and had left in their luggage. In the baggage of those returning from California he often found nuggets of gold — specimens of gold and quartz — parcels of black sand containing much fine gold, china silks, and other things of much value. Where money was to be gained, or safety insured, Mateo did not hesitate at murder. Persons who had insisted on keeping in sight of their luggage had been decoyed from the old 'military road,' taken near his rancho, and there murdered. He generally made his agreements with travellers through other persons, and so manaojed to throw the dansrer of detection on another. Mateo was a large muscular man, with quick, sharp, and restless eyes, and was about thirty-six years of age.",julia,,
3,"This was tried, and tailed. Defences were speedily made, and a breast-work raised inside, on which the soldiers of the monastery met die foe, and repulsed them again and again. After repeated attempts to carry the monastery by assault had failed, liagnal, surprised at the resistance he met with, determined to destroy the building by fire. He directed the great oaks of the avenue to be felled, which, with the help of gunpowder applied to the trunks, was soon effected ; and collecting all the combustible matter the island afforded, they were applied, together with these great trees, to complete the catiistrophe of this unhappy building. It was a saying of Sir Thomas Moore*s, that "" men go to Hell with more pains than they might go to Heaven with."" 80 the work of destruction, done even upon stone and timber, costs infinitely more labour and trouble than their preservation would have required. The attempt to burn tlie convent was some- what alarming to its inmates, and the prior ordered a diversion to be made, by an attack upon the enemy's cannon, which still continued to annoy the monastery.",julia,,
4,"Mrs. Fielding,"" he said, "" I beg your pardon — I beheve I have kept you waiting — but, perhaps, Miss Fielding, when she arrives at home, will explain the accident that happened to detain us. Now I am more myself — I am at your service, and with your leave, I will mount the box to direct the man where to drive, as it is a dark night and the road to Fairy Villa is not generally known."" Then without waiting for an answer, Sidney placed himself by the coachman's side and they drove off from the theatre at a quick pace towards Brompton, while Mrs. Fielding, naturally surprised at his singular proceedings, turned to her daughter, to hear the explanation he alluded to. This being soon given by Frances, was commented on by both ladies with anxiety and distress, and when Mrs. Fielding arrived at her own door, in unfeigned sorrow she expressed her concern that her daughter should have been the cause of so unpleasant an af- fair. And then the kind-hearted lady tried to utter some words which would prevent further mischief, tried to treat the matter lightly, pronounced the stranger to be a worthless character, and endeavoured to convince Sidney that the affront was not worth noticing— though, at the same time, she felt very grieved and very unassured that her listener would ever be brought to think in the like manner. Sidney, in fact, did not say a word in reply to her advice, but walked by her side up the gravel path leading to the por- tico of the villa in utter silence, and as the servant, who was summoned to the door by his knock, admitted them into the house, he bid them adieu.",julia,,
5,"well ! terrible has been the retribution. I am desolate ! — hopeless ! — a very wretch ! ' "" * Oh, no, Freida ! ' she exclaimed, clasping my hand between hers. \ Turn to God, — a never-failing staff in the hour of sorrow and tribulation !",julia,,
6,"'I see,' said Irons, with a great oath, which seemed to the maid wholly uncalled for; and he came up another step, and held the iron rail and shook it, like a man grasping a battle-axe, and stared straight at her, with a look so strange, and a visage so black, that she was half-frightened. 'A what's the matther wid you, Misther Irons?' she demanded. But he stared on in silence, scowling through her face at vacancy, and swaying slightly as he griped the metal banister. 'I _will_,' he muttered, with another most unclerklike oath, and he took Katty by the hand, and shook it slowly in his own cold, damp grasp as he asked, with the same intense and forbidding look, 'Is Mr. Lowe in the house still?' 'He is, himself and Doctor Toole, in the back parlour.' 'Whisper him, Katty, this minute, there's a man has a thing to tell him.' 'What about?' enquired Katty.",julia,,
7,"My trips are short enough to be sure; but you have no business at the Mint to bring you back just when you are beginning to enjoy yourself; and I am sure I should be sorry to hurry you.""' "" But, Edgar, if I were to stay a month, I could not spend all this money."" "" Xot on yourself, little woman, I dare say; for you are not one of the wives who like to see their husbands work hard that they may spend in idleness. You work as hard as I do; and if you do not bring me quite such a bundle of notes as this, neither do you bedizen yourself like half your neighbors in this street. But, Hester, we have carried our economy a little too far."" 11 I am so glad to hear it!"" cried Hester. ""But I did not know how much we might spend ; and it is always safer to spend too little than too much."" "" True; but now is a good time to be setting ourselves up with some things that we want.",julia,,
8,"Do you know how long ago it is since you wrote to me ? Are they trying to make us strangers, too, Edith?' ' No one is so wicked,' said the young girl, with a slight laugh ; ' but, if you are anxious for news from us, why do you not come and get it ? Your father says you do not care for us, and do not want us to care for you. I am afraid he is right.' ' That is what he says ? A charitable judgment, as usual.' '",julia,,
9,"Why have you takeri away the key ? I wanted to say my prayers beside her. She was the one creature who loved me, and now I have lost her. We have been friends for thirty-two years, and I always hoped I should go first. It is cruel revenge to keep me away from her."" ""Cousin Tess,"" returned Violet, firmly, ""you must listen to me a moment. I am taking no revenge ; I would not be so cruel to my mother's friend, however she has treated me.",julia,,
10,"But he is more powerful than ever ; and in requital of the foul slanders which you and others have uttered against him, his Majesty has agreed to give him the title of his dead brother and to create him Earl of Mar."" Gordon was astounded by this new proof of the deluded King's weakness. ""It is an act of madness that will cost him his throne,"" he exclaimed. "" But you cannot be rightly informed; such monstrous contempt of nobles and people alike would be opposed by Cochrane himself as too perilous even for his ambition to profit by."" ""His ambition knows no fear. His G-race's own lips gave me the intelligence of the new honour he had conferred on his favourite. '' """,julia,,
11,"Nevertheless, Reuben was unwilling to do such things as his good mother had taught him to consider sinful in a faithful Jew ; so* after much inward deliberation, in vv'hich way to act for the best, he resolved to perse- vere in guarding his own conduct during this journey, according to Jemima's and his Rabbi's lessons, and keep on friendly terms with his cousin, and nominal master, with- out copying his example, where it might compromise his rehgious duties. Reuben felt glad to know he should have, on their re- turn, the benefit of his honoured mother's advice for his future guidance. The proceedings of Wolfe, by which Reu- c2 ben had been so much annoyed, were, as yet, but trivial omissions in themselves, though to a Jew highly important. He neglected his ablutions, and, for three successive mornings, had sat down to breakfast witli- out even touching his phylacteries; and, worst of all, during their halt on the Sab- bath, which was at a village ale-house, as there was not any Jewish residents near, Wolfe had more than once stirred the fire, and taken up the lighted candle, though in a way between jest and earnest, he pretended to have quite forgot himself at the moment. Encouraged by the quiet demeanour of Reuben, the result of his secret determina- tion, Wolfe, who mistook it for a growing apathy towards observances so often a heavy burden, began to act still more unreservedly. Hitherto, he was only chargeable with sins of omission ; those of actual and open commis- sion had not yet been added.",julia,,
12,"Six months later, and I was traversing the same streets, with very little money in my purse, but with my stock of knowledge vastly augmented. During this six months I had acquired an experience of the world more extensive, than in any six years of my previous life. I had paid somewhat dearly for this expe- rience. My travelling fund had melted away in the alembic of cafes, theatres, masque- rades, and "" quadroon "" balls. Some of it had been deposited in that bank (faro) which returns neither principal nor interest ! I was almost afraid to "" take stock "" of my affairs.",julia,,
13,"They also inserted the following advertisement in the Handley Cross “Paul Pry:”— “TESTIMONIAL TO MR. PIGG. “At a highly respectable and influential ADJOURNED MEETING of the friends of Mr. Pigg, held at Mr. 'wen Sherry's, the sign of the Salmon, in Handley Cross, It was resolved,—That the list be kept open for a fortnight, to enable the outlying members of the hunt and others, to assist in honouring a gentleman who deserves so well at their hands, for his cheery affability and unremitting exertions in the noble cause of fox-hunting.” And so, leaving the testimonial to the benefit of its fortnight's grace, we will return to our notices of the pack. The season was wearing out apace. An unusually dry spring brought the country forward, and set the farmers to their fences and their fields. Ploughs and harrows were going, grain was scattering, and Reynard was telegraphed wherever he went. “You bain't comin' this way again, I s'pose,” observed each hedger, as he drove his stakes into the ground to stop up the gaps.",julia,,
14,"In the course of half an hour, Charles had suffered so much from the various and rapid succession of passions rarely awakened in him, that had he judged from his own feel- ings, he might have concluded that the hasty good-night of Emma was dictated by the hurry of the moment ; but the idea that she had seen him act unworthy of himself, in his hasty conduct, one moment struck him as the cause of her indirect censure; the next, he condemned her as cruel and inconsiderate, towards one whose heart she had beheld prostrate at her very ^eQX, and he determined to resent her cruelty : on the strength of this determination, he walk- ed very manfully home; but when he ar- rived at the entrance to the house, the re- collection of her pale disordered looks, her bleeding arm, and, above all, that sweet ebullition of awakened tenderness, that *' dear Charles'* which broke from her in the first moment of his appearance, he found it was quite impossible to live all night ■without assuring himself of her health ani safety at least ; and^ with hasty stepSj he bent his way to the castle-house. When arrived in the lane whkh led to the house, it was completely dark, and the lights in the chamber-windows convinced him that the family had retired for the jiight, and that it was utterly impossible for him to see or hear any thing more af Emma for this night ; he now cursed his own folly in giving way to a resentment which was groundless, and pictured to him- self the anger she would probably feel, at the cruel neglect she had a right to impute to him ; and his vexation and grief were now all directed against himself; and h« still stood lingering round the garden, when the sound af a horseman in the neighbour- ing lane roused him from his reverie, and convinced him of the impropriety of lin* gering near the house at such an hour ; he started, and making his way through paths frequented only by himself and me, escaped the horseman, and soon arrived at the Fark, and entered the parlour just as I hai finished reading Collinses Ode on Fear \b my mother-in-la^, who was very partial t3 that elegant and enthusiastic poet; we botTi remarked, that Charles looked as if he had been witnessing those visions described by the bard ; his complexion was pale and flushed by turns, and his fine hair fell- iw disorder about his face. '* I have w^alked fast,"" said he; "" and feel excessively fatigued; I shall goto bed im*- mediately."" My mother pressed him to take supper, but he refused any besides a glass of wine, wb-ich having swallowed, he retired, leaving a sense of trouble on our minds, which broke up our little party. On meeting at breakfast the next morn*- kig, Charles, though looking pale and pen- sive, was certainly himself again, for his usual sweetness of temper pervaded every action. My father had just been asking him, if he had made a purchase of the colt he had gone to see, and he was beginning to give us an account of his expedition the evening before, when the baronet was told that Robertson, the steward, vrished to speak with him : my father told the ser- A'ant to beg Mr. Robertson would step in, as his business might be easily attended to, there being only his own family pre- sent.",julia,,
15,"Come, darling, put on your shawl, and let us have a breezy walk on the cliffs before the day darkens ; neither of these gentlemen are worth the slightest estrangement between such sisters as we are. Whether Tony likes me or not, don't steal him Irom me, and Til promise you to be just as loyal with regard to the other. How I'd like to know what they are talking of there !"" As it is not impossible the reader maj^ in some slight degree participate in the fair widow's senti- ment, we mean to take up the conversation just as it reached the time in which the remark was applied to it. Miss Becky Graham was giving her com- panion a sketchy description of all the persons then at the Abbey, not taking any especial care to be epigrammatic or picturesque, but to be literal and truthful. "" Mrs Maxwell — an old horror — tolerated just because she owns Tilney Park, and can leave it to whom she likes ; and the Lyles hope it will fall to Mark, or possibly to Bella. They stand to win on either.""",julia,,
16,"Bertie's a capital fellow, but his mo- ther is a rare humbug — as I saw from the first."" o2 "" It's all very well to say steer clear of her ; but unfortunately papa likes her, and what can I do ?"" Bessie did not perceive the real drift of Reginald's speech. Any matrimonial de- signs on the part of the widow, with regard to the Squire, had never entered, and were not likely to enter her head. Her com- panion looked grave — he saw rocks a-head if she did not ; but his was a nature that sought the agremens of life, and he turned the conversation at once into another chan- nel. "" I've got my commission,"" he said; ""Lord Sturm wrote to my father this morning. I'm awfully lucky to have got it so soon.",julia,,
17,"i. 7 had entertained against him as a son-in-law ; she had spoken of it to her daughter very seriously, and Helen had repeated her words to Arthur. He had promised her to reform in this respect ; and yet, within one half-hour or so, and in her mother's pre- sence, he had made, or attempted to make, two wagers ; and one of them, as it seemed to her, of a very considerable amount : he had also lost it, which, in a woman's eyes, greatly heightens the immorality of misde- meanours of that description. It was, to say the least of it, very thoughtless conduct on her Arthur's part ; if he were restrained by no other motive, he might have refrained from such conduct for her sake. "" Mamma and I are not accustomed,'* said she, "" to hear gentlemen betting fivers; it makes me nervous."" "" Nervous ! It puts me all of a twitter !"" ejaculated Mrs. Somers. """,julia,,
18,"Athelstone's mesalliance has utterly ruined him."" Fitzroy Square and the poisons of heterodoxy he drank in there at every pore were, as yet, unknown quantities in the popular calculation. It did not transpire for some little time that, while his wife was absent at Brighton, he passed nearly every evening in the congenial circle of admirers to whom a democratic lord was a novel and very precious boon. Among these admirers, the only dangerous one, perhaps, to his wife's peace of mind was a lady of great personal attraction, who arrived from Germany shortly before Lady Athelstone's return to London. Madame de Waldeck was an Englishwoman divorced from the Prussian she had married three or four years since, by mutual consent, and with that facility which the laws of that country afford. She thought of delivering a course of public lectures on this subject (with the laudable view of freeing the British mind from the swathing bands of preju- dice), and also one upon dress, her principles concerning which she practically illustrated in her own person.",julia,,
19,"Poor Taylor was as honest a man as ever lived ; but yet, confounded by his cross-examination, and not very well recollect- ing the exact circumstances of events which had taken place when his hair was standing an end with horror, he had told, or admitted — which comes to the same thing — an exceedingly great falsehood. None of the men who exa- mined the spot with Mr. Tracy, had gone down to the hawhaw ; but the counsel had put it in such a way that, in his confused remembrance of the events, he was at first afraid of denying it; and afterwards became persuaded it was true. Had he remained much longer in the witness-box, and had the counsel been permit- ted to pursue his own course, there is probably nothing in the range of possibility which Mr Taylor would not have vouched upon oath ; for he was becoming more and more confounded every moment. The counsel for the prosecution saw the state he was in too well to venture to re-examine him ; and thus he was suffered to depart in p^ace. The next witness who was called was ' Wil- liam Sandes ;' and a stout countryman entered the witness-box, with a somewhat heavy, dogged countenance. He deposed as follows : — """,julia,,
20,"I. 2 ' This old thing ! Oh, you can't mean it !' ' But I do, indeed. Above all things I hate a fuss, such as people generally make about weddings. I think it indecorous — absurd,' said he, with more irritability than Nanny had yet seen him show about anything. The poor child's expression was grow- ing tragic.",julia,,
21,"I have been to Switzerland, but I never attempt to paint Swiss scenery. I think it is too vast, altogether too magnificent and sublime, to be adequately represented on canvas ; it is too wide to be narrowed down, with its ice-crowned mountains, gorge, stream, and glacier, to six feet of canvas ; no colouring could do justice to it, no per- spective give an idea of its vastness — it must be seen to be appreciated, or, if not seen, had better be imagined than dwarfed down and cramped like a child's toy-village. Be- sides, we have so much soft, picturesque home-scenery lying in unknown, or, at least, unfrequented regions ; when I have ex- hausted these home-subjects, perhaps I may go abroad for new."" **""When I saw you first, I had no idea jou were a real artist."" "" Did you think I was a sham ?"" "" No, but I mean I thought you painted a little to please yourself, just as I do. I did not know you made it a business, and worked for money."" "" Humph !",julia,,

23,"He that would form a lively idea of the regions of the damned, needed only to witness for six hours a scene to which I was confined for many months. Not for one hour could I withdraw myself from this complexity of horrors, or take refuge in the calmness of meditation. Air, exercise, series, contrast, those grand enliveners of the human frame, I was for ever debarred, by the inexorable tyranny under which I was fallen. Nor did I find the solitude of my nightly dungeon less insupportable. Its only furniture was the straw that served me for my repose. It was narrow, damp and unwholesome. The slumbers of a mind, wearied like mine with the most detestable uniformity, to whom neither amusement nor occupation ever offered themselves to beguile the painful hours, were short, disturbed and unrefreshing.",julia,,

25,"Thus, too, his tongue would protrude and lick the dust. He endured, in a word, those treble agonies which the highly-wrought and imaginative inflict upon themselves. The hours passed, and still no one came near him; he called, and the guard appeared at the door, but only to see what was the matter, and finding his prisoner safe, at once resumed his walk to and fro. The soldier did not, for his own sake, dare to enter into conversation with a prisoner under arrest for such an offence; he might be involved, or suspected. Had it been merely theft or any ordinary crime, he would have talked freely enough, and sympathised with his prisoner. As time went on, Felix grew thirsty, but his request for water was disregarded, and there he remained till four in the afternoon. They then marched him out; he begged to be allowed to speak, but the soldiery did not reply, simply hurrying him forward.",julia,,
26,"You will make an exception in my favour?"" "" Ne!"" answered Caillet, sternly. "" Do not suppose, Thibalt, that I am attempting to cajole you ; I know you too well for that. You are not apt to be cheated ; and, to say truth, are not worth the trouble of cheating. Your qualities are different from those of Morne, and "" "" You desire to use both for your own pur- poses,"" interrupted Thibalt. ""And if I do, where is the harm?"" de- manded Caillet. *^",julia,,
27,"Soldiers, tighten the rope,"" shouted Briggs, without vouchsafing the slightest attention to her remonstrance, and Philipson was about to yield, as many a brave man had done before him, to the force of circumstances, when Mrs. Kezia Briggs, coolly advancing to the spot, deliberately severed the cord by which Bethuliel and Stunner were at- tempting to draw him to the gibbet. "" In the name of everything that is infernal, what do you mean by that, woman?"" vocife- rated Briggs. ""To save you from the perpetration of a deadly sin,"" she replied. At that moment Althea Woodville, who had just landed below the garden, rushed forward, and, throwing herself at the feet of her guardian, begged the life of Philipson with all the eloquence of tears and passionate entreaties.

32,"She was thinking of the thousand fragile threads which bound her fast to that one spot on earth. And as she thought of it, the spirit of that home seemed present with her, and wave after wave of emotion swept with soft glittering beauty over her soul. But to Sidney, with no key save that which was dimly deciphered by eye and brow and lip, no knowledge of her thoughts could come. He only saw a face which shaded, as a hand that is held up before some candle, the rays of a light that burnt within. He saw the dilated pupils, the widely opened, steadily held lids ; the mouth that drew in hastily the short quick breath ; the colour that had risen and spread itself over ear and throat. And as he looked down upon this girl, with all the promise of a full and glorious womanhood shown in each lineament of her face, he felt his soul stirred and moved toward her with an unwonted interest. Her face had been mutely up- turned to his but for the space of several seconds, and yet in that time the depth and earnestness of her character had worked upon him.",julia,,

34,"He had heard that a pleasant thing might be made of life out there amongst the scrub, for a set of young fellows who were not afraid of roughing it, or having a breeze now and then with the natives. And Hugh felt as if he could thoroughly enjoy rough- ing it, or sparring with the natives even to within an inch of his life. That was the very thing he could enter into, under present cir- cumstances. Or the gold diggings. That was a fine opening, they said, for a young man. Or he might go with his cousin, the mate of the ship Lucy^ on a whaling expedition to Greenland.

Hester, who left home in the highest spirits, with a vague hope that Brail might be invited, felt a greater depression than she chose to acknowledge when she discovered her mistake, but it vexed her still more to reflect that under such unfavourable conditions it would have been far better not to have met at all.

36,"He paused too. He turned to her. His honest brown eyes were gazing down on her; his two hands were stretched out to take hers. "" My dear,"" he said, very gently, "" when I told you just now that I loved you, I only told you but a very, very little part of what is in my heart. I love you so truly, Agnes, that nothing you could ever do, no words you could ever speak, could alter my love. Will you be- lieve that ?"" '* I do— oh, I do !"" "" And — and — oh, my love, as long as you are still as you are — as long as you are free to accept or listen to my love — I shall go on hoping and trusting that time may alter all this ; I shall still feel that our long, long friendship has given me a better right so to look on you and think of you than any other man in the whole wide world.""",julia,,

39,"One only comfort had chequered her sorrow with satisfaction ; and this was the total absence of the Baron dello Sguardo. Throughout the whole day, he came not near her apartment. On the following morning, she awakened with a start and a scream from her unquiet and dreamful slumber. The loud report of the two cannons vibrated amongst the sur- rounding rocks, and shook the bed beneath her. She sprang from it in alarm, and yet in hope ; and the latter feeling was confirmed when, from the window of her chamber, she beheld the unwonted stir in the court below and the active preparations for defence that were evi- dently made by the followers of the Baron. She hastily dressed herself; and/turning from so agitating a sight, betook her to the outer room, and, dropping upon her kness, prayed fervently for the success of those whom, she doubted not, were he deliverers. Her weak-spirited maid, to whom we have before alluded, was not, however, as composed as her mistress.",julia,,
